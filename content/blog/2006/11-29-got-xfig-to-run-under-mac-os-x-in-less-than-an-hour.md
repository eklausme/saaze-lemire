title: "Got XFig to run under Mac OS X in less than an hour"
---



Using only knowledge gathered based on my [previous posts](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2006/11/23/xfig-running-on-mac-os-x-thanks-to-fink/), I&rsquo;m happy to report that I was able to get XFig running under Mac OS X in less than an hour thanks to the magic of [Fink](http://fink.sourceforge.net/).

So far, my most difficult task has been to get used to yet-another-crazy-keyboard-layout and to get my HP Laserjet 1012 running. Turns out that Apple does not support the HP Laserjet 1012 printer through a Windows share, for some odd reason. Downloading the cups PPD for the HP 1010 printer and installing it manually didn&rsquo;t help. The workaround was to actually use the same printer, still connected to a Windows box, but this time, shared by my Linux box (if you are lost at this point, sorry), as a generic postscript printer. It is a bit crazy, but it works.

Now, the machine is compiling KDE. I&rsquo;ll probably only know if it worked tomorrow. This time, I&rsquo;m trying to follow the instructions found on [Fink&rsquo;s web site](http://fink.sourceforge.net/news/kde.php) so I might have better luck than my previous attempts.

I&rsquo;ve also found this great list of [open source software for Macs](http://www.nothickmanuals.info/doku.php/opensourcemac) on nothickmanuals.org.

I might also try to [update Apple&rsquo;s X11](http://www.nothickmanuals.info/doku.php/opensourcemac) before trying to run OpenOffice, this time.
