title: "After Oracle and Microsoft, IBM sets its database free"
---



I wrote about this [two months ago](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/11/23/ibm-oracle-and-microsoft-freeing-their-databases/), but IBM finally announced it is setting a limited version of DB2 free. It was unavoidable after Microsoft and Oracle doing the same. It seems clear that the various free open source databases, [MySQL](http://www.mysql.com/), [PostgreSQL](http://www.postgresql.org/), MaxDB, [Firebird](http://firebird.sourceforge.net/) and Ingres, are putting a lot of pressure on the database vendors.
