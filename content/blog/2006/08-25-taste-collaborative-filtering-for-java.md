title: "Taste &ndash; Collaborative Filtering for Java"
---



Here&rsquo;s yet another [Collaborative Filtering library: Taste](http://sourceforge.net/projects/taste/#about). This one is written in Java and supports Enterprise Java Beans.

> Taste is a flexible, fast collaborative filtering engine for Java. The engine takes users&rsquo; preferences for items (&ldquo;tastes&rdquo;) and returns estimated preferences for other items. For example, a site that sells books or CDs could easily use Taste to figure out, from past purchase data, which CDs a customer might be interested in listening to.
