<p>Some people view the importance of Crick and Watson&rsquo;s discovery as revealing the mechanism behind heredity, however, at the end of day I think it is more important because it made biology computable &#8211; they revealed the instruction set. The algorithmization of biology is old news. The algorithmization of consiousness is a more interesting modern problem. Kristof Koch, who was one of Crick&rsquo;s main collaborators in the past decade, is moving in that direction but calling it the neuronal correlates of consiousness NCC. Will we find a similiar instruction set for consiousness that will make it computable?</p>
