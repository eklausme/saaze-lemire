The [DOLAP 2006](http://www.cs.uoi.gr/~dolap06/program.html) preliminary technical program is out. Rokia Missaoui and Omar Boussaid have a paper in called &ldquo;Enhanced Mining of Association Rules from Data Cubes&rdquo;. There is one paper on wavelets and range sum queries. At this point, we do not even have the abstracts so I will wait before commenting further on the papers.
