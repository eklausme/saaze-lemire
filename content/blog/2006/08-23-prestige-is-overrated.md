Grigori Iakovlevitch Perelman proved the longstanding PoincarÃ© conjecture and posted the solution on [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/find/math/1/au:+Perelman_G/0/1/0/all/0/1). One of the most difficult problems in Mathematics today. However, instead of publishing his work in a prestigious journal, he simply dropped it on an Internet archive. Maybe the [Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigory_Perelman) story is meant to teach us [something](http://acrlog.org/2006/08/23/collaboration-copyright-and-reclusive-math-geniuses/):

> If your ideas are important enough and you get them out, people will pay attention to them, whether you publish in a high prestige peer-reviewed journal or not.
