Yaroslav has this [thought provoking article on the Curse of Dimensionality](https://yaroslavvb.blogspot.com/2006/05/curse-of-dimensionality-and-intuition.html):

> (&hellip;) consider a cube of width 1. As dimension increases, the volume stays the same. But (&hellip;) eventually almost all the mass is concentrated in the corners (meaning outside of the inscribed sphere).



The plot is especially shocking: at d=8, the sphere of diameter 1 inscribed in the unit cube has a negligible volume!
