title: "Looking for a RDF to SVG tool"
---



I&rsquo;m looking for a tool to convert RDF files to SVG files. I&rsquo;m currently teaching RDF without using pretty RDF plots because I haven&rsquo;t yet found a way to generate them automatically. I know about 4suite which W3C uses, but the results are not pleasing to my eyes.

__Update__: Actually 4suite and specifically, the 4rdf tool, works alright. However, I typically need to manually edit the SVG file, to adjust the font size.
