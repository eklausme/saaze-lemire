title: "Looking for an all-recording plug-in for Firefox"
---



Dear reader,

I&rsquo;m looking to record everything I ever browse on the Web using Firefox. That is right. I want a copy of every single document, Web page, query, and so on, I ever encounter. I also want to record the content of every single form I submit. The result should be adequately protected so that it is not possible to have access to the data without access to my machine. It would be akin to the [wayback machine](https://archive.org/) except that it would cover only the stuff I have seen. I have not yet decided whether it should record all the [youtube](https://www.youtube.com/) videos I watch, but I guess it should.

Ideally, it should be able write the data on a [portable disk](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Drive-9W3638-556/dp/B0006TIF2K). 

Why do I want to do this? Why not. Actually, I would then want to use this data to build a fancy database that would support things like drill-down or roll-up queries (Ã  la [OLAP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OLAP)). 

If you know how to build this, want to help, or know of such a plug-in, please drop me a line.

I&rsquo;m also running a competition to decide how to call such a thing. I initially thought about calling it a [webex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Webex) but it turns out that&rsquo;s a trademark. Then I decided that [Hammerspace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hammerspace) might be a better name, or maybe [Magic Satchel](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic_satchel)? What do you think?
