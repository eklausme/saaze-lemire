title: "Google funding the implementation of Slope One in Drupal"
---



I learned on Ted Serbinski that Scott Reynolds, who implements the [Slope One Collaborative Filtering algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One) in [Drupal](https://www.drupal.org/), is being paid by Google. It is one of 14 projects that Google decided to fund. Way to go Google!
