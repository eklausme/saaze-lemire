title: "Desktop Search using open source swish?"
---



This is old news, but one of my colleagues asked me if I knew about an open source search engine she could use for her knowledge management course. Here&rsquo;s the answer:

- [Swish-E](http://swish-e.org/)
- Swish++
- [Lucene](http://lucene.apache.org/core/)


This made me wonder why I haven&rsquo;t thought about using Swish-E, for example, to build some sort of cross-platform Google Desktop? Haven&rsquo;t the KDE Kat people thought about using Swish-E. What&rsquo;s wrong with Swish-E? Couldn&rsquo;t it index my files as a background task? I know Google uses a compressed index, while Swish-E probably doesn&rsquo;t. But this is a small issue?

Anybody knows? Anybody is willing to look at Swish-E for Desktop searching?
