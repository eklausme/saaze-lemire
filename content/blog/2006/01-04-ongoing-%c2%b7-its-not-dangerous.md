Tim Bray&rsquo;s [It&rsquo;s Not Dangerous](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/03/08/BloggingIsGood) post was the tenth more popular post of the year according to BlogPulse. It amazes me that someone like Tim is not only a good technical guy who invented things like XML, but he is also a top notch communicator. Surely, there is a strong correlation between the two!

> __Ten Reasons Why Blogging is Good For Your Career__

1. You have to get noticed to get promoted.

2. You have to get noticed to get hired.

3. It really impresses people when you say â€œOh, I&rsquo;ve written about that, just google for XXX and I&rsquo;m on the top pageâ€ or â€œOh, just google my name.â€

4. No matter how great you are, your career depends on communicating. The way to get better at anything, including communication, is by practicing. Blogging is good practice.

5. Bloggers are better-informed than non-bloggers. Knowing more is a career advantage.

6. Knowing more also means you&rsquo;re more likely to hear about interesting jobs coming open.

7. Networking is good for your career. Blogging is a good way to meet people.

8. If you&rsquo;re an engineer, blogging puts you in intimate contact with a worse-is-better 80/20 success story. Understanding this mode of technology adoption can only help you.

9. If you&rsquo;re in marketing, you&rsquo;ll need to understand how its rules are changing as a result of the current whirlwind, which nobody does, but bloggers are at least somewhat less baffled.

10. It&rsquo;s a lot harder to fire someone who has a public voice, because it will be noticed.
