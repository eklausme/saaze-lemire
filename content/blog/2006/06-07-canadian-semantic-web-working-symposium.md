title: "Canadian Semantic Web Working Symposium"

The [Canadian Semantic Web Working Symposium](http://www.ift.ulaval.ca/~kone/SWIG06/) was held yesterday in Quebec City and it was a great success. Of particular interest was the keynote speaker, [Michael Huhns](https://cse.sc.edu/~huhns/) who argued that web services ought to be thought of as agents. The best paper award was given out to Jie Zhang and [Robin Cohen](https://cs.uwaterloo.ca/~rcohen/) for their paper &ldquo;A Trust Model for Sharing Ratings of Information Providers on the Semantic Web&rdquo; which I thought was really well thought out. You can [buy the proceedings on amazon](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/redirect?link_code=as2&#038;path=ASIN/0387298150&#038;tag=daniellemires-20&#038;camp=1789&#038;creative=9325).
