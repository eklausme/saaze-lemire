title: "The word &#8220;computer&#8221; is not associated in any way with math."

Here are quotes from a nameless recruiter working for a nameless school:

>  (&hellip;) The approach to discuss computer science with the legions of students who express interest in math and don&rsquo;t know what to do with it, has not worked well. As a general rule the word &ldquo;computer&rdquo; is not associated in any way with math. High school computer courses tend to be viewed as job skills courses, and certainly not a real discipline to continue studies in. (&hellip;)


> Forensics continues to be a primary area of interest for students expressing interest in science.
