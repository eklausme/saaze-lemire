title: "Firefox Extension Development Tutorial"
---



Through [Downes](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=33609), I got to this Firefox Extension Development Tutorial. Maybe I ought to try my hand at fixing the &ldquo;browsers lack a good text editor&rdquo; problem.

Well, this will have to wait after I prepare my lectures for CS 6905, prepare week 7 of INF 6460, mark the homeworks for INF 6450, finish my next paper, finish sorting out the papers for [CSWWS 2006](http://www.ift.ulaval.ca/~kone/SWIG06/) (we got some really good ones), register for Curves and Surfaces 2006 and apply for another grant. Oh! And with some luck, finish the paperwork so that this super smart guy from France can come do a post-doc with us.

Oh! Yeah! I&rsquo;ll be writing lots of Firefox extensions this year!
