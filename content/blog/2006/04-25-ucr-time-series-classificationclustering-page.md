Eamonn Keogh just posted this announcement:

> We are please to announce a new resource for researchers working on time series classification and clustering.

The UCR Time Series Classification/Clustering page has the largest collection of test datasets (with objective class labels) in the world.

Furthermore, in order encourage research that is both reproducible and comparable to other works, we have created training/test data splits, and listed results for some standard benchmarking algorithms such as Euclidean Distance and Dynamic Time Warping.

We have also made Matlab code available that allows all results to be exactly reproduced.

The page is located here: [http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/](http://www.cs.ucr.edu/~eamonn/time_series_data/)

We encourage donations of datasets/results and suggestions/bug fixes.
