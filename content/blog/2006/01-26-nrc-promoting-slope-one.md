title: "NRC Promoting Slope One"

My old research group at NRC is promoting the [Slope One algorithm](https://lemire.me/fr/abstracts/SDM2005.html) for recommender systems:

> The performance of Slope-One is remarkable; recommendations can be culled from collection of a million rated songs in a matter of seconds.


Note that the people who make this statement are only indirectly related with the authors of this algorithm (Anna and me) and they certainly could have chosen to work with other algorithms now that we have left NRC for quite some time (2 years). They base these statements on in-house, independent implementations they have designed.
