title: "Google launches online, shareable, spreadsheet tool!"

Google has done it again! [Spreadsheets.google.com](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=wise&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2F&amp;followup=https%3A%2F%2Fdocs.google.com%2Fspreadsheets%2F&amp;ltmpl=sheets) offers free (as in &ldquo;no money&rdquo;) shareable, online spreadsheets. The UI feels a lot like Excel and you can save and load Excel documents. Unfortunately, it does not appear to support the [Open Document Format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument). Unlike Excel, you can easily share your Google spreadsheet.
