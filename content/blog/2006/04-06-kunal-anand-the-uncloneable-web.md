Kunal Anand talks about the uncloneable web:

> Anyone can write AJAX or make a usable interface. But how many people can actually program a library and API for delivering facial recognition over port 80? The average web developer will discover that the learning curve for replicating [Riya](http://www.riya.com/)&lsquo;s features is substantially steeper as the underlying technology is not web-based, but probably in some low-level language like C or C . If this is the new breed of web applications, then I am excited to be a developer.


Ok. Let&rsquo;s be clear about this: not everyone can make a usable UI. I sure can&rsquo;t. I was once asked to teach a human interface course, and I refused. I&rsquo;m not even ever going to try again.

This being said, I think he&rsquo;s got a point. A lot of the current breed of web applications are easy to clone. Creating useful and uncloneable applications is important. Google is one such example. To a lesser extend, [our very own indiscover](http://www.indiscover.net) is hard to clone (or is it?). But I believe more will come and more must come.

Maybe this is maybe where the pendulum will finally swing back: when we start to produce sophisticated web applications few people can replicate. We must stop trying to sell bits, and we must sell sophisticated services instead!
