title: "Suresh says we donÂ´t need publication counts"

[Suresh points out](http://blog.geomblog.org/2006/07/we-dont-need-no-stinkin-publication.html) that Richard Feynman wrote only 37 research papers.

I entirely agree with what Suresh implies. To be fair, the main Canadian science funding agency (NSERC), while it asks for your publication list, actually asks you first what your top 5 contributions are. The concept of a contribution is open ended. Maybe you had an idea and wrote 10 papers on it. Or maybe you wrote a journal paper on a crucial idea. Or maybe you designed one piece of software. Or maybe you wrote a patent. Maybe you lead a research project. Naturally, contributions tend to lead to publications, but the relation is not bijective.

This doesn&rsquo;t mean that the number of publications is irrelevant. __There is a correlation between the number of papers someone wrote and the importance of his contributions. But need I remind you, dear reader, that a correlation is not the same as causality?__ Having written 255 papers (<em>yes, I met a man who had such a pub. record this very summer</em>) does not imply you did anything significant other than keeping journals and conferences alive.

I suggest that __publishing frequently__ is more important than publishing many papers. If you stop publishing for many years, then release a very thick book (Wolfram&rsquo;s example comes to mind), you are not doing yourself a favor. Also, it is tremendously difficult to get and keep a job or a grant if you stop publishing for a long time. Other than that, we ought to actually read what people write instead of, I don&rsquo;t know, counting the number of words/pages/papers/books?

Recently, I added a table with count statistics to my c.v. Maybe I should take it out.
