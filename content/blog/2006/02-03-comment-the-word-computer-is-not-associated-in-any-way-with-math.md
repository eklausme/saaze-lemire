<p>I&rsquo;ve got a quote about the use of computers in K-12 education:</p>
<blockquote><p>
&ldquo;Suppose it were music the nation is concerned about. Our parents are<br/>
worried that their children won&rsquo;t succeed in life unless they are<br/>
musicians. Our musical test scores are the lowest in the world.<br/>
After much hue and cry, Congress comes up with a technological<br/>
solution: &lsquo;By the year 2000 we will put a piano in every classroom!<br/>
But there are no funds to hire musicians, so we will retrain the<br/>
existing teachers for two weeks every summer. That should solve the<br/>
problem!&rsquo; But we know that nothing much will happen here, because as<br/>
any musician will tell you, the music is not in the piano!&rdquo;<br/>

Computers in Education.&rdquo;
