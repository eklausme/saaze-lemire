Adam Rogers [makes a bold prediction](http://www.wired.com/2006/09/the-new-sky-lab/?pg=3):

> Eventually, printed journal articles will be quaint artifacts. Scientific papers will be living documents with data published on Web pages â€“ commented on, linked to, and mirrored by labs doing the same work 6,000 miles away. Every research effort will have thousands of reviewers working in real time. Today&rsquo;s undergrads have never thought about the world any differently â€“ they&rsquo;ve never functioned without IM and Wikipedia and arXiv, and they&rsquo;re going to demand different kinds of review for different kinds of papers. It&rsquo;s in their nature.

I think that the science media of the future will be electronic and read/write. We will annotate, link, cross-reference more than ever before in the coming years. We are in the middle of a paradigm change.

I do not think that publishing houses need to go out of business. I do not think that traditional universities and research laboratories will disappear. However, everything is growing more distributed. Physical location and physical support is becoming irrelevant.

Actually, by 2015, I will not even bother to get up of bed. I will just sit there by my computer all day. Come to think of it, that is precisely what I do right now except that I don&rsquo;t stay in bed.
