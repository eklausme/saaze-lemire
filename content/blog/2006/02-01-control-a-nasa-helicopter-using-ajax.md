title: "Control a NASA helicopter using AJAX"
---



[Will exposes his secret NASA work](http://www.entish.org/wordpress/?p=322). Thanks to him, you can fly a NASA helicopter using AJAX. It is a very pretty and neat looking web application, very modern and worth playing with. It took me some doing before I could get the helicopter to actually cycle through its targets though, but it was well worth the time spent. This bodes well for web applications. For the purpose of the demo and due to a limited budget, I understand that an actual helicopter will not follow your orders, but you can get a pretty good idea of what it might be like.

Now, I would still not drive my car using such an AJAX application, but who knows?
