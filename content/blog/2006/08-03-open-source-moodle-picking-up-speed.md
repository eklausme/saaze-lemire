title: "Open Source Moodle picking up speed!"
---



Just as BlackBoard [sues ](http://jarche.com/2006/08/blackboard-sues-d2l-over-lms-patent/) because it has a patent granting it all rights over Learning Management Systems, the Open Source (GPL actually!) [Moodle](https://moodle.org/) is pickup up speed. The Open University, arguably the largest online university in the world, has [adopted it](http://www3.open.ac.uk/media/fullstory.aspx?id=7354&#038;filter=student) and so has our very own [UQAM](http://www.moodle.uqam.ca/). Myself, I use another Open Source solution, [SPIP](http://www.spip.net/en), these days.
I&rsquo;m old enough to recall, several years ago, when Linux was not a serious platform. When the GPL was a communist invention.
The joke is very much over. If you are selling software, and there is an Open Source alternative, be very worried. It might not look like much initially, but free software has a way to grow when you are not looking.
