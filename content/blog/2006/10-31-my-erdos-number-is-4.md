Fascinating. My [ErdÅ‘s number](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erd%C5%91s_number) is 4. According to wikipedia, the median ErdÅ‘s number amongst all working mathematicians at the turn of the millennium is 5 and the average is 4.64. In this case, being below average is __good__. Here is how it happened: Paul ErdÃ¶s coauthored with Janos Galambos who coauthored with Eugene Seneta who coauthored with Serge Dubuc (my thesis cosupervisor).
