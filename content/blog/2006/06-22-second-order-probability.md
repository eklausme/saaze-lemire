Luciano Floridi poses the problem of second-order probabilities:

> (&hellip;) we actually lack a theory of second order probability, let alone a philosophical justification for it.


By second order, he means &ldquo;probabilities about probabilisties&rdquo;.
I beg to differ with Luciano. What about this reference?
