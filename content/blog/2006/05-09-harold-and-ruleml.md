title: "Harold and RuleML"
---



[Harold Boley](http://www.cs.unb.ca/~boley/) was over in Montreal yesterday. He gave a talk on [RuleML](http://wiki.ruleml.org/index.php/RuleML_Home). The big news, to me, is that RuleML has been modularized into sublanguages. Of particular interest to me was their [DataLog](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Datalog) sublanguage (and they have a [tutorial about it](http://ruleml.org/papers/tutorial-ruleml-20050513.html)). To be honest, I didn&rsquo;t even know what &ldquo;DataLog&rdquo; meant before this talk. [Guy](http://intra.info.uqam.ca/Members/tremblay_g) stopped by as well as many interesting people including FranÃ§ois Magnan and Olga.

Now, someone should go out and implement a nice DataLog-RuleML engine on top of MySQL.

We also talked about Web Services, Logic and so on. Finally, we agreed to start a network of researchers making their publication lists available as XML (I have been [doing so](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DanielLemiresArticlesOnArxiv) for a long time).

Finally, we stopped by Idialia to see the lovely Anna and her office. It seems like Idilia now has a white paper out, but I can&rsquo;t seem to navigate their web site.
