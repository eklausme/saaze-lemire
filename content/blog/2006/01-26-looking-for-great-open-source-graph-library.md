title: "Looking For Great Open Source Graph Library"
---



I&rsquo;m currently looking for good open source graph theory. It needs to support basic algorithms for problems like minimum cost maximum flow. I need a GPL-compatible license.

- In C++, I found that the [Boost library](http://www.boost.org) has something pretty complete together with Python wrapping. But I hate working with Boost: it is monolithic, the code is obscur (to me) and they require their own build tools instead of the default unix way (./configure; make; make install).
- In Python, I found [NetworkX](http://networkx.github.io/) but while it has great plotting facilities, it lacks supports for fancy algorithms.
- In Python, I found kjbuckets which is self-described as &ldquo;a Python extension module that provides fast set, graph and mapping operations&rdquo;.
