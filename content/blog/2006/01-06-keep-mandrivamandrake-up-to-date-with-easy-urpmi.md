title: "Keep Mandriva/Mandrake up-to-date with Easy Urpmi"
---



Urpmi is a tool allowing to quickly install packages on your machine: it will resolve all dependencies and download the packages for you. All you need to do to install, say gnuplot, is to type, as root, &ldquo;urpmi gnuplot&rdquo;. However, I thought you had to carefully select your mirrors on your own. Not true: Easy Urpmi is a web application to configure your urpmi database automagically. And it works extremely well.
