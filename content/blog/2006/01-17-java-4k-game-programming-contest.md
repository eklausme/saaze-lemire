title: "Java 4K Game Programming Contest"
---



I just stumbled on the [Java 4K Game Programming Contest](http://www3.javaunlimited.net/). This looks like an excellent contest for programmers out there trying to get into the video game industry or just trying to prove their hacking skills:

> The Java 4K Programming Contest is the ultimate byte-squeezing Java challenge! Using only 4096 bytes, competitors use every trick up their sleeve to create an entire game. The current Java 4K is running from December 1st, 2005 &#8211; March 1st, 2006.


I really like the size limit. In the good old days, we really just had 4KB of internal memory. I programmed a few cool games back when computers still had green on black screens, including a full Othello implementation (including the AI), and it ran very well on probably less than 4K.
And I think 4K ought to be enough for a great game prototype. Myself, I would try to do it without using obfuscated code and try to get points for programming elegance.
