> Many predict dramatic changes to the way science is done, and suspect that few traditional processes will survive in their current form by 2020. (&hellip;) The wireless sensors that were US$300 a year ago are $100 today, and will be $30 next year. A similar phenomenon occurred with DNA chips and gene sequencers. It is important to recognize this pattern; it is universal. And so although some sub-disciplines may reach a plateau in data generation, other technological innovations will take their place. Scientists in 2020 will continue to work in an exponential world.
