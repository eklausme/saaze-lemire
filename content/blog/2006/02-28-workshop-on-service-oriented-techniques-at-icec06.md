My friend Yuhong is organizing a [Workshop on Service Oriented Techniques at ICEC06](https://flydragony.blogspot.com/2006/02/promote-my-workshop.html). Yuhong is cool and the workshop looks quite respectable so if you are into this sort of thing, consider submitting a paper!

> Service oriented techniques are used for building software applications that use services available in a network such as the Web. The driving forces come from both the software engineering community and the e-business community. Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) promotes loose coupling between software components so that interoperability across programming languages and platforms can be achieved. Extending the classic middleware functions, SOA techniques incorporate the demands of e-business by adding process modelling and management functions. The description of services covers not only software interfaces but also semantic business information. Services can be dynamically discovered and composite services can be built from aggregates of other services.

The aim of the SOT workshop is to present recent research findings on service oriented techniques. We welcome papers from both academia and industry. We especially invite submissions based on theoretical foundations or innovative industrial projects. Possible topics include, but are not limited to the following:

* Formal methods for service modelling and computing<br/>
* Dynamic selection and composition of services/applications<br/>
* Dynamic coordination of services/applications<br/>
* Managing and monitoring services/applications<br/>
* QoS-enabled services/applications<br/>
* Data integration of distributed services<br/>
* Selection and interaction among services<br/>
* Context-aware services/applications<br/>
* Performance evaluation of middleware for service-oriented computing<br/>
* Semantic Issues in service integration<br/>
* Combinations of Semantic Web technology with Web Services<br/>
* Innovative applications
