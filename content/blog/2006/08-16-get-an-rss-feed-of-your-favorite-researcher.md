Want to monitor the publications of a researcher? As long as he submits his papers to [arXiv.org](http://arxiv.org/) and/or [Cogprints](http://cogprints.org/), you can use [citebase](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/) to get a RSS feed: enter the author&rsquo;s name, do a search, then click on the RSS link. ArXiv also has [RSS feeds](http://arxiv.org/help/rss) if you are only interested in this particular repository.
