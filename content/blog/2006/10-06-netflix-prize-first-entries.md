title: "Netflix Prize: First Entries"
---



The [first few entries in the Netflix prize ](http://www.netflixprize.com/leaderboard) are up. The Netflix prize is 1 millions $ given to the first person to be able to improve by 10% the Netflix recommender system according to RMSE (Root Mean Square Error) metric. People asked me if I would participate. Well, no I will not be involved as a participant, but I will be an observer.

I got an email from Anno Langen who is participating (under the pseudonym <em>Actual Proof</em>) and he is currently in eigth place using an algorithm from my [Scale And Translation Invariant Collaborative Filtering Systems](https://lemire.me/fr/abstracts/IR2003.html) paper. Because Netflix is using the RMSE metric, I think that Scale and Translation invariance becomes an important factor.
