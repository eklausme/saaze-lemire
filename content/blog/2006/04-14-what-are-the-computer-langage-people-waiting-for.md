title: "What are the computer langage people waiting for?"
---



The glorious time when people could design a new insightful computer language is gone.

Or is it? In our Data Warehousing and OLAP classes, we cover MDX and various APIs for OLAP. Arguably, [MDX](https://fr.wikipedia.org/wiki/MDX) is de facto the standard OLAP language. But as far as languages go, it is just ugly. Microsoft chose to mimick closely SQL and yet, extend it dramatically into a multidimensional setting with a large dose of abstraction. I&rsquo;ve never designed computer languages, but I&rsquo;ve used them and just like a painter can recognize a bad brush even if he can&rsquo;t design a brush, I just don&rsquo;t like MDX.

But even if I&rsquo;m wrong, you can&rsquo;t hope to teach MDX to a busy decision maker even if he has sufficient programming experience: 

> I believe that OLAP using MDX with Mondrian requires expert language knowledge and it would be very difficult for a user, with only domain knowledge, to be able to issue correct queries. ([Hazel Webb](http://www.unbsj.ca/sase/csas/faculty/webb.html))


What is needed is a simpler, easier langage. Something someone who knows about control structures (loops and if clauses) and has a basic understanding of what a data cube is (drilling-down, rolling-up, slicing and so on), can quickly pick up and use, say within a day.

Would make a great Ph.D. thesis.
