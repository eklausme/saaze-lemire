<p>I really think that blogging for KM is the long-term, consistent benefit of blogging. Unless you&rsquo;re an A-lister, there are few other benefits other than meeting some interesting people. Both Seb &amp; Stephen could be considered to be A listers, but even that was obviously not enough. Perhaps it&rsquo;s an easier justification for me as a freelancer &#8211; who else would I talk to?</p>

<p>Like with anything else, do it only if you enjoy it regardless of the consequences. I find that it is easier for me to blog when I am not worried about the impact of what I am saying, whether someone will care about it, whether the quality of my blogging compares to some other bloggers, etc.</p>
<p>I think that those who try it and then cut back feel that they don&rsquo;t enjoy it as much: the potential benefits that you list are only an epsilon in the grand scheme of things.</p>
