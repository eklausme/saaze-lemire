title: "ACM Launches several new journals"

I didn&rsquo;t see this pass by, but ACM has launched several new journals. At least some of these will be top tier. Here are some titles I like:

- Transactions on Knowledge Discovery in Data
- <a href="http://tweb.acm.org/">Transactions on the Web<br/>
</a>
- <a href="http://tos.acm.org/">Transactions on Storage<br/>
</a>


This can only be a __good thing__.
