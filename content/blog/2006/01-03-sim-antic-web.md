> Game Software publisher Maxis, producers of the hit games Sim City and The Sims, have announced what they expect to be their biggest success ever &#8211; __Sim-antic Web__. The game, where users play simulated XML experts, messaging architects and linguistic ontologists in order to build the perfect, or at least most comprehensive, self-aware distributed architecture, is expected to come out in both SOAP and REST editions. The starter set will feature both a __Sim Berners-Lee__ and __Sim Bray__. RDF not included.
