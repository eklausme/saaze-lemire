If you are a [Google Scholar](https://scholar.google.com) user, you will notice that it now allows you to search for similar articles: do a query and then look for an hyperlink below one of the returned paper. I don&rsquo;t usually like these fuzzy similarities queries, but sometimes, there is no other way to mine for interesting articles.
