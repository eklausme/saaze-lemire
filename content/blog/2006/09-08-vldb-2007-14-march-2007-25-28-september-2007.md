VLDB 2007 is a premier international forum for database researchers, vendors, practitioners, application developers, and users. We invite submissions reporting original results on all aspects of data management as well as proposals for panels, tutorials, and demonstrations that will present the most critical issues and views on practical leading-edge database technology, applications, and techniques. We also invite proposals for events and workshops that may take place at the conference site between September 23th and 25th before the VLDB 2007 conference.
