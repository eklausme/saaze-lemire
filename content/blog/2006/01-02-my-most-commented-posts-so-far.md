title: "My most commented posts so far"

Following on my earlier post about wordpress statistics, I decided to pull out my most frequently commented posts:

<code>select count(comment_id) as cnt,post_title,guid<br/>
from wp_posts, wp_comments<br/>
where comment_post_id=id<br/>
group by post_title having cnt>12 order by cnt desc;<br/>
</code>

It seems that often commented posts fall in one of these categories:

- offer some help regarding a very common technical problem (winfixer);
- have a controversial title/content;
- present or discuss a definition (blogging/CS education/&hellip;);
- present recent research results people can possibly use right away (collaborative filtering).


Topics that are especially popular seem to be:

- what are universities doing, what should they teach and how should they teach it?;
- useful, nice and __simple__ programming tricks;
- how can I use social software (blogging) to get ahead?


I should point out that my goal is not to get more comments. I don&rsquo;t write this blog to get comments, though please, do comment away!
