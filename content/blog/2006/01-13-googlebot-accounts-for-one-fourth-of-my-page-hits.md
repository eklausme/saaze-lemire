I just had a look at the browser stats for the visits to my site. The results are strange. Googlebot seems to be taking up a huge share of the traffic. I think I have read an explanation somewhere, maybe it was on Tim Bray&rsquo;s site. Nevertheless, these numbers are scary:

Browser                  |count                    |percentage               |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
MSIE                     |7890                     |34.8                     |
Googlebot                |5631                     |24.8                     |
Firefox                  |1956                     |8.6                      |
undisclosed              |1125                     |5.0                      |
Yahoo                    |994                      |4.4                      |
Bloglines                |929                      |4.1                      |
msn                      |860                      |3.8                      |
Mozilla                  |758                      |3.3                      |
Konqueror                |409                      |1.8                      |
Google                   |353                      |1.6                      |
Safari                   |263                      |1.2                      |


(The second Google is not Googlebot. The stats are for 24 hours. They exclude some parts of my web site.)

It seems that a large fraction of the visits to my sites are from search engines. What does this says about the current state of the web?
