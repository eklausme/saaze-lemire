title: "Statistical Data Mining Tutorials by Andrew Moore"
---



Andrew Moore has an amazing page full of [Data Mining Tutorials](http://www.autonlab.org/tutorials/index.html) on just about every important topic in Data Mining! My only regret is that his tutorials take the form of PowerPoint slides in PDF format which is not very readable. However, if you need to go quickly through most of Data Mining, this is quite good!
