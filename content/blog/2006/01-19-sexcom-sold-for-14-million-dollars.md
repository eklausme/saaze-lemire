[Slashdot reports that the sex.com domain name sold for $14 million.](http://slashdot.org/) Recall that people spend billions every year buying software, which effectively costs nothing to copy.

The best route, these days, to become really rich is to find a way to create something that effectively costs nothing to produce, though it may cost a lot to design, and then, find a way to make sure you are the only one who can make an infinite number of copies for free. The problem is that we are collectively wising up to this get-rich-quick scheme.

I think that a more durable model, though a much less effective one, is to find a way to offer a service nobody else can match. Google comes to mind. It is a model based on constant hard work which appeals a lot more to the Catholic boy in me.
