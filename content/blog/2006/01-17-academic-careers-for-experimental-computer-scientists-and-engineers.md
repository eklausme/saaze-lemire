[Peter Turney](http://www.apperceptual.com/) sent me a pointer to [Academic Careers for Experimental Computer Scientists and Engineers](http://www.nap.edu/read/2236/chapter/1) which is somewhat old (1994) book made available online.

Here are some of the chapter titles (all are available online):

- WHAT IS EXPERIMENTAL COMPUTER SCIENCE AND ENGINEERING (ECSE)?
- AN ACADEMIC CAREER IN ECSE
- EDUCATIONAL DIMENSIONS OF ACADEMIC ECSE
- EVALUATING RESEARCH IN ECSE
- A POSITIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR ACADEMIC ECSE
- SPECIAL NEEDS AND CONCERNS OF NON-DOCTORATE-GRANTING AND LESS RECOGNIZED INSTITUTIONS
- FINDINGS AND RECOMMENDATIONS
- SURVEYING THE ECSE COMMUNITY
- COMPARING JOURNAL AND CONFERENCE PUBLICATIONS
