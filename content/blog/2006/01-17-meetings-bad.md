title: "Meetings == bad"

According to Education Guardian, [meetings are bad](https://www.theguardian.com/education/2006/jan/17/highereducation.research1):

> (&hellip;) having too many meetings (&hellip;) may have negative effects on the individual.


As one who goes to great extends to avoid meetings and any synchronous event, I think we definitively need to move from a synchronous culture (meeting people at fixed time, using the phone) to an asynchronous culture (such as email).

The problem, of course, is that lots of people can&rsquo;t write. Even university professors, sometimes, can&rsquo;t write. Sure, they wrote a thesis one day, or so you hope, but they simply can&rsquo;t sit down and communicate their ideas in a written form without great efforts.

I&rsquo;m annoyed and tired of these people. If your ideas are not clear enough to write them down in an email, without any fuss (read: send a word documents with carefully chosen fonts), then I have no time for you.

And no, I don&rsquo;t think people are dumb. They just don&rsquo;t want to have to think and work. Sitting down and chatting is so much easier than sitting down alone and having to write something coherent.

We have to move on to the next level.
