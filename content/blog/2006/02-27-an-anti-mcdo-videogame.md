title: "An Anti-McDo Videogame"

Some anti-McDo activists have come up with a &ldquo;The Sims&rdquo;-like [McDonald&rsquo;s Videogame](http://www.mcvideogame.com/). My wife spent the week-end playing. I think she managed to take the company up until 2045. The graphics and sounds are gorgeous and the simulation is really interesting. Appears to be Flash driven. I usually dislike Flash for web site design, especially corporate web sites, but this is one instance where Flash really shines. ([Source](http://www.ledevoir.com/).)
