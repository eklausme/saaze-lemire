title: "Beyond the algorithmization of the sciences"

Thomas Easton promotes algorithms as a higher form of science in his paper Beyond the algorithmization of the sciences:

> 
Algorithms have thus made biology as useful a science as physics, chemistry, and computer science. But are algorithms enough to move biology closer to the throne? Are they math?<br/>
(&hellip;)<br/>
Five decades ago, most mathematicians would have said no. Then in the 1970s, they discovered the value of computers for &ldquo;proving&rdquo; theorems (&hellip;)


Myself, I haven&rsquo;t had time to spend much time thinking about it, but it is quite clear that I value algorithms at least as highly as I value theorems.
