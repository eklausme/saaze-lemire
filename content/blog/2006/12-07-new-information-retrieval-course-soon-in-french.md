title: "New Information Retrieval Course Soon (in French)"
---



My INF 6460 Information Retrieval course will start soon. You can see most of the content online. Information Retrieval is the &ldquo;science of finding stuff&rdquo; (or &ldquo;how Google does it&rdquo;). 

 In fact, you can almost take the course on your own without paying if you know French. I say &ldquo;almost&rdquo; because if you do it on your own, you will be missing out on my support and on getting your assignments marked. But mostly, the Web site is self-contained.

I think it is a pretty exciting course.

If you want to take it, get in touch with me.
