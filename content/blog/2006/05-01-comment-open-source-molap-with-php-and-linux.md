<p>Hi! I&rsquo;m just starting to learn about Linux. I&rsquo;m researching the compatibilty of my hardware right now. I heard Red Hat was good for beginners so I&rsquo;m looking on their website. Just a couple questions..</p>
<p>1. I&rsquo;m not finding anything about HD&rsquo;s. Are they all supported then?</p>
<p>2. I did see some compatible motherboards.. Does that mean that certain motherboards aren&rsquo;t going to work?</p>
<p>3. What ways (short of writing my own drivers) are available to work around incompatibilites with a particular Linux distribution? In other words, can you download drivers etc or is it not that simple?</p>
<p>4. I want to put it on its own excusive HD, and sometime after Christmas build a whole new computer for it from scratch. Am I going to have a lot of trouble with newer motherboards?(533MHz/Rambus/ATA 133)</p>
<p>Thanx</p>
