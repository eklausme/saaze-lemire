Fred [responded ](http://fgiasson.com/blog/index.php?title=the_semantic_web_landscape_is_changing&#038;more=1&#038;c=1&#038;tb=1&#038;pb=1#comments) to my recent <em>[anti-Semantic Web](/lemire/blog/2006/09/14/do-not-ask-me-to-be-a-keynote-speaker-on-ontologies-and-inference-engines/)</em> post by saying that the &ldquo;Semantic Web landscape is changing.&rdquo;

I really like Fred&rsquo;s post. Here is where he agrees with me:

> The proof that both RDF and web ontologies are useful is yet to be done.


Here is where we disagree:

> Everything is changing, and everything should explode&hellip; soon!


I honestly do not see the Semantic Web being about to take off. As Bob DuCharme pointed out, people are doing &ldquo;ontologies for the sake of ontologies&rdquo;. This will get old very quickly. If 8 years and millions of dollars was not enough to produce a single remotely useful application, what will it take?

Are semantic web researchers becoming semantic web implementers? I do not see this happening. The papers are every bit as theoretical and as disconnected from real-world problems as they ever were. 

Here are some common myths:

- Google is getting worse every day. Only the Semantic Web can save us. (False: Google is not getting worse, it is constantly improving and at an alarming rate at that.)
- Inference engines and ontologies are more sophisticated or somehow more intelligent than current database solutions such as relational databases, data mining algorithms, and so on. (False: Current database technology is highly sophisticated and built on lots and lots of theory.)
