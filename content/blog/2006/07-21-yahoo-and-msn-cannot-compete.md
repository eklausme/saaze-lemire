title: "Yahoo and MSN cannot compete?"

According to [Greg Linden](https://glinden.blogspot.com/2006/07/yahoo-and-msn-cannot-compete.html), despite their best efforts, Yahoo and MSN keep losing the search war against Google.

> What is the problem at Yahoo and MSN? After four years of trying, they just seem to be slipping further and further behind. First, MSN showed a drop in web search market share, down to 12.9% from 15.3% a year ago.



As someone who does not own any stock in any of these companies and who does not have a vested interest in any of these companies, I am actually quite pleased that a company run by engineers wins over &ldquo;traditionnally managed&rdquo; companies. Naturally, Microsoft is a large company and places like Microsoft Research are not exactly full of suits seeking the latest acronyms. I am quite certain that Yahoo has also large components mostly run by engineers, but I do get the feeling that Google is unique in that the entire company is ran by engineers and scientists. __When Google wins, creative technology people win.__

Greg Linden is a good example of what a technology person can do __despite__ the suits running the show. Greg is responsible for making collaborative filtering ubiquitous through the Amazon recommender system.
