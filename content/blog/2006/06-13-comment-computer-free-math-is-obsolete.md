<p>Would that mean that mathematics is nothing but number crunching. Mind-boggeling complex number crunching, but number-crunching nonetheless? Is there any place for creativity in this process? How does that fit in?</p>
<p>(I left most of my mathematics behind with my BSc over ten years ago, so it is not surprising that I would have more questions then answers.)</p>

<p>Zeilberger is most certainly not a number cruncher. He says quite the opposite, stating that mathematicians are a superior race.</p>
<p>What he comments on, is the fact that if you are not using computers to do math, you are exploring the world using your own two feet instead of using a jeep and a GPS.</p>
<p>Notice that most, if not all, mathematician use computers these days to assist, at least, with the algebra. But it would be akin to the jogger who takes his car to drive to the gym: mathematicians still, very much, do the same type of math, with the lemma/theorem/proof routine. However, Zeilberger goes a step further and says we have to move to a new type of mathematics, just like going from the marathon to the rally.</p>
<p>This is partially motivated by the fact that journals won&rsquo;t publish his work, and he claims that it is because he is ahead of his time.</p>
<p>(Don&rsquo;t get mixed up and read that Zeilberger is not a published mathematician, this is not what I&rsquo;m saying!)</p>
