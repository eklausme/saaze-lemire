---



This is too good not to pass on. Ronen Feldman posted slides from his ICML 2006 Tutorial on Text Mining.

> In this tutorial we will present the general theory of Information Extraction and will demonstrate several systems that use these principles to enable interactive exploration of large textual collections. We will present a general architecture for information extraction and will outline the algorithms and data structures behind the systems. The Tutorial will cover the state of the art in this rapidly growing area of research. Several real world applications of information extraction will be presented in the areas of business intelligence, competitive intelligence, bio information, and military intelligence.
