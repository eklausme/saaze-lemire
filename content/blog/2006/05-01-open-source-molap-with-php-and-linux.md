title: "Open-Source MOLAP with PHP and Linux"
---



There is a now an online demo of the open souce MOLAP engine [Palo](http://forum.jedox.com/?s=9639fd38cf94bb1840f8175a098c8dfacd8ff0dd) running a PHP application on a Linux-based Palo Server. The application is somewhat limited, but it is a proof-of-concept. This is a very small step for open source Business Intelligence, but a step forward nonetheless.

(Our very own [Lemur OLAP](http://www.nongnu.org/lemur/) once had an online demo in Python, but it has since died.).
