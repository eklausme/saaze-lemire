title: "Is the software industry heating up?"

Repeatedly, in the recent past, I&rsquo;ve heard people claim that the IT sector was heating up and that there was much demand for new graduates. Is this true?

__What is happening in the schools:__

[Michael Stiber reports](http://www.cra.org/CRN/articles/march06/vegso.html) that the number of students who began a Computer Science degree in the USA, went down by 50% between 2000 and 2005. Notice that in 2004, I reported a [drop by 28%](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2004/10/14/more-on-the-cs-enrollment-drop/). Many people, back then, assumed that this catastrophic number meant we were due for a swing of the pendulum. Clearly either we are going to get a swing of the pendulum later, or it will not happen. Physics went through a terrible enrollment drop in the seventies, and they are [still waiting for the pendulum to swing back](/lemire/blog/2005/11/10/computer-science-now-is-physics-of-the-seventies/)! Add to this that [China, and Asian in general, may not keep on sending their students to North America](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2006/03/02/china-soon-to-export-degrees/) for much longer, and you get that North American schools are up for a bumpy road.

__What is happening on the job market__:

I lack recent data unfortunately. The Time Herald-Record reports that for 2005 Computer Science graduates, the salaries were down by 2%. Recall that [they went up by about 2% in 2004](http://www.jobweb.com/SalaryInfo/05_summer.htm). Sounds to me like there is nothing to get excited about.
