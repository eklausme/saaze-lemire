<p>I think it is more accurate to say that humans and computers are good at different things. I will deliberately avoid the loaded term &ldquo;intelligent&rdquo; and assert that computers, as per quantitative measures of performance, sometimes outperform humans on very specific (and, typically, narrow) tasks. As an example, computers are much better at credit scoring than humans, under real-world conditions, when both are presented with the same information on credit applicants.</p>
