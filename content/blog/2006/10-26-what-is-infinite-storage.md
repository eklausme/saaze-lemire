title: "What is infinite storage?"
---



A colleague of mine, a Ph.D. in Physics, objected to my use of the term &ldquo;infinite storage&rdquo; in some lecture notes I posted on the Web.

I think that infinite storage is something that might be possible in my lifetime. What does &ldquo;infinite storage&rdquo; means? Let us consider how much is required to achieve the mythical (digital) [memex](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memex).

- To record everything you read in a year requires 25MB.
- To record everything you hear in a year requires 100GB.
- To record everything you see in a year requires 10TB.


Hence, I argue that whenever I will be able to buy a cheap 10TB disk at my local electronics store, I will have infinite storage. Currently a portable 1TB drive can be had for $569.

What about recording everything I hear? Right now, I can buy a [slick 100GB portable drive](https://www.amazon.com/Seagate-Portable-External-Drive-9W3638-556/dp/B0006TIF2K) for $160.
Interesting question: how would I ever search through all these sounds?
And what about all these people who will get upset that I am recording them?
