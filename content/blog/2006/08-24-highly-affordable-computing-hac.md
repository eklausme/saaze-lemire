Slashdot reports that [Amazon will let you use a powerful Xeon-based machine for $0.10 per hour](http://slashdot.org/story/06/08/24/1555250/amazon-betas-elastic-grid-computing-service). This means that for $10 per hour, you can have 100 machines cranking away on some task. You need to be a Linux user though. That&rsquo;s what I call <em>Highly Affordable Computing</em>.
