title: "If you are using a computer or a cell phone right now, please continue"

I [agree with Stephen](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=35885), if you are into e-Learning, and you listen to one talk this year, listen to [this one](http://www.downes.ca/files/audio/nz3.mp3). He begins his talk with &ldquo;if you are using a computer or a cell phone right now, please continue.&rdquo; As he says these words, you initially assume he is about to ask you to turn off your computer and your cell phone. No. Stephen wants you to feel connected. Stephen Downes is no ordinary man.
