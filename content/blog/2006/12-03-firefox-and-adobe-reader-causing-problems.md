title: "Firefox and Adobe Reader causing problems?"

Firefox and the Adober Reader plugin is a bad mix. The plugin has the benefit that it can display PDF files &ldquo;on the fly&rdquo; (without loading them all first), but on our home machines, it tends to eat up a lot of memory and even crash. [John Haller has written](http://johnhaller.com/jh/mozilla/adobe_reader.asp) a nice piece about disabling the plugin.
