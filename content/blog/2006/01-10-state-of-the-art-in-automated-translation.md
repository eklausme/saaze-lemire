[Véronis compares Systran and Reverso](http://blog.veronis.fr/2006/01/traduction-systran-ou-reverso.html), two popular automated translation tools.

In order to compare them, I take a sentence in English, have it translated in French, and then back. This has the benefit that even if you don&rsquo;t read French, you can appreciate the quality of the tool.

I start with this sentence:

> I gave John a piece of my mind.


[Systran](http://www.systranet.com/translate) gives me:

> J&rsquo;ai donné Ã  John par morceau de mon esprit.


and back:

> I gave to John per piece of my spirit.


Whereas Reverso gives me

> J&rsquo;ai donné Ã  John un morceau de mon avis(esprit).


and back,

> I gave to John a piece of my opinion (spirit).


I think Reverso is better here. Note that most search engines out there use Systran.
