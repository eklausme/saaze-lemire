title: "XML Schemas are harmful: is this news?"
---



We now have [Slashdot quoting Tim Bray](http://it.slashdot.org/it/06/12/05/0025208.shtml) on XML Schemas:

> W3C XML Schemas (XSD) suck. They are hard to read, hard to write, hard to understand, have interoperability problems, and are unable to describe lots of things you want to do all the time in XML.


How is this news? Tim is just saying what anyone, I really mean anyone, who ever tried to get anything done with XML Schemas knew already. It is only a bit of news because Tim invented XML, among other things.

The problem with technology is that there are too many people who think you can understand technology just by learning the buzzwords and hiring programmers. It is like cars: how can you tell if it is a good car without driving it? Well, you cannot. No matter how wealthy you are, at some point, you have to sit in the car and drive it to determine whether you will like it.
