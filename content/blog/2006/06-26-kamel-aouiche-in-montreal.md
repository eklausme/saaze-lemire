title: "Kamel Aouiche in Montreal!"
---



I met [Kamel](http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/~kaouiche/) in Montreal today. I invited him over for a post-doc and he arrived 2 months ahead of time (talk about eagerness!) from Lyon ([Eric laboratory](http://eric.univ-lyon2.fr/)). Kamel is a very promising, young (well, younger than me) researcher in OLAP, Data Warehousing and Data Mining. Among other things, Kamel will be working of view size estimation in data warehouses.

Oh! How did Kamel learned about me and my work? Nah! Not a conference or a talk&hellip; nothing like that, he just got to me through my blog! So this blog has a purpose after all!
