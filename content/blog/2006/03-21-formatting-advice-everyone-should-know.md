title: "Formatting advice everyone should know"

I just finished reviewing, as an editor, some of the camera-ready papers for [CSWWS 2006](http://www.ift.ulaval.ca/~kone/SWIG06/). Here are some rules everyone ought to know:

- When citing papers, do not use multiple brackets (such as [1][2][3]), use a single one (such as [1,2,3]).
- Typically, we abbreviate see &ldquo;Figure 10&rdquo; to &ldquo;see Fig. 10&rdquo;, but never, never, do we abbreviate &ldquo;see Table 10&rdquo; to &ldquo;see Tab. 10&rdquo;.
- Your abstract should be self-contained: no reference to a footnote or to your reference section should be made in the abstract.
- Non-breakable spaces are your friends. Under Word, you can get a non-breakable space as [ctrl][space]. Use them before most references such as &ldquo;Fig.{non-breakable}10&rdquo; and &ldquo;as in{non-breakable}[1]&rdquo;. 
- Don&rsquo;t use bitmap images unless you know what you are doing. If you are using bitmap images, __turn off the compression__. I know the image looks fine on your screen, but high quality printing and bitmap diagrams don&rsquo;t mix.


It doesn&rsquo;t matter how brilliant you are, if you don&rsquo;t follow these rules, people will notice and your paper will get lower reviews and fewer citations.
