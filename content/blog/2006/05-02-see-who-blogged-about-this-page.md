Matthew Hurst shares this cool [bookmarklet](javascript:location.href='http://www.blogpulse.com/search?query='+encodeURIComponent(location.href)) to help you find out quickly who blogged about the page your browsing now. If you&rsquo;ve never used a bookmarklet before, it is quite easy: just drag the URL to your favorites and click on it while browsing a page.
