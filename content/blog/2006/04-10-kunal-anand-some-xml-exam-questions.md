title: "Kunal Anand: Some XML exam questions"
---



Kunal has almost picked up my challenge on his blog: come up with [deep homework questions](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2006/02/06/most-frequently-asked-question-about-xml/) having to do with XML.

> 
- Given at least 10 blog/link feeds, determine the top ten outbound URLs?
- Parse an iTunes library file and capture all the unique artist/albums.
- Given a user&rsquo;s XML file from del.icio.us, determine the top 10 intersecting tags.
- Scrape a dynamic list from a web site (i.e. the Google Zeitgeist) and serialize a well-formed Atom feed.




The last one seems like mostly hard labour probably requiring quite a bit of fiddling.

The other ones are all interesting because they are examples of aggregation and that&rsquo;s not trivial to do in XSLT/XPath. Naturally, Kunal suggests to solve these problems using a nice script language like Python, but solving them in XSLT is much more fun because it is harder.
