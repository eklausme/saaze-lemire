title: "The Cost of Graduation"

From [Ian](http://www.unreasonableman.net/2006/04/the_cost_of_gra.html) I got to this [Observer article](http://observer.guardian.co.uk/uk_news/story/0,,1759544,00.html?gusrc=rss). The story is that university education is becoming less attractive as the costs increase and the salaries for graduates don&rsquo;t correspondingly increase. The net result is that universities might be in an increasingly competitive game as western universities progressively lose their edge in the world wide market and as students look for more cost efficient alternative.

> (&hellip;) more and more A-level students ask about alternatives to university, said the author of the research, Peter Brown, director of Gabbitas Educational Consultants. (&hellip;) we are seeing Chinese universities [are also] more financially attractive.


Asian universities stand to win big. In the western world, the first university to offer high quality, but significantly cheaper university education, by essentially cutting down on the fat and keeping what really matters, is going to win big time.

We are at a pivotal point where it might be good timing for a radical rethinking of university education.

Did I mention that you can listen to Stanford lectures on your ipod? See [http://itunes.stanford.edu/](http://itunes.stanford.edu/). Chances are good that Stanford will be among the winners.
