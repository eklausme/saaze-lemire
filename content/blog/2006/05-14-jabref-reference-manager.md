[JabRef reference manager](http://jabref.sourceforge.net/index.php) is a Java-based tool to manage your BibTeX references. &ldquo;JabRef runs on the Java VM (version 1.4.2 or greater), and should work equally well on Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.&rdquo;

(Thanks to Harold Boley for pointing it out.)
