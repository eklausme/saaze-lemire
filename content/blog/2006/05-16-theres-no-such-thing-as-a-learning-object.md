title: "ThereÂ´s No Such Thing as a Learning Object"
---



Michael Feldstein, Assistant Director, SUNY Learning Network, says that [there is no such thing as a learning object](http://elearnmag.acm.org/index.cfm).

We learn by doing. We consider. We compare. We measure, discuss, debate, critique, test, and explore. We try, fail, and try again. Learning is an activity. It&rsquo;s a process. Given this undeniable fact, the term &ldquo;learning object&rdquo; can only be an oxymoron. An object is a thing. We don&rsquo;t learn from things. We learn from doing things.<br/>

I believe the term &ldquo;learning object&rdquo; has become harmful. It hides the same old, bad lecture model behind a sexy buzz phrase.
