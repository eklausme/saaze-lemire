<p>I&rsquo;m back to using an aggregator, so when I read the excerpt, I was going to suggest Boost. Strangely, I don&rsquo;t have anything in my del.icio.us links to answer this question. I dug a little, and found the GTL again, but immediately noticed the strings attached: &ldquo;Please use your academic address, e.g. .edu, if you have. Otherwise your are classified as a &ldquo;commercial&rdquo; user.&rdquo; Definately not libre software.</p>
<p>LEDA has something too, and you can easily convert from LEDA to Boost: <a href="http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/leda_conversion.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.boost.org/libs/graph/doc/leda_conversion.html</a><br/>
But LEDA isn&rsquo;t libre software either.</p>
<p>Not sure what you mean by Boost being monolithic, though. Like I mentionned before, it&rsquo;s designed to be incorporated into the next C++ standard. I can only hope it has weak dependencies.</p>
<p>After digging a little more, I found what might be a good source of info: <a href="http://del.icio.us/xamdam/python+graph" rel="nofollow ugc">http://del.icio.us/xamdam/python+graph</a><br/>
and his blog: <a href="https://pythonzweb.blogspot.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://pythonzweb.blogspot.com/</a></p>
<p>Can you give us an example why Boost doesn&rsquo;t do it for you?</p>
<p>P.S.: I waited too long I guess before submitting this form, and code a &ldquo;wrong code&rdquo; error. I took precautions, and copied my comment before submitting. I got my comment back in the textarea, but the &lsquo; where escaped with a and the comment was cut at the first &ldquo;. (just letting you know my experience, not trying to beat a dead horse ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Forgot to mention this one, in the public domain, and recent:</p>
<p>(from README.txt) &ldquo;This is PADS, a library of Python Algorithms and Data Structures implemented by David Eppstein of the University of California, Irvine&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/</a></p>
<p>Never worked with it though.</p>

<p>Thanks Robin.</p>
<p>Good find! I should have remembered <a href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/PADS/</a>, but an all Python library cannot be fast enough for my needs.</p>
<p>What do I hold against Boost? Have you ever worked with it? I simply dislike it. It is not elegant. It is a giant pile of code, with obscur coding practices.</p>
<p>The fact that it was designed by people who work on the C++ standard is not a very good reference. The C++ standard isn&rsquo;t exactly sane.</p>
