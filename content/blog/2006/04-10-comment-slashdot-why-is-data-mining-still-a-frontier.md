<p>I&rsquo;ve always wanted to get into Data Mining, but I never learned where to start. Daniel &#8211; do you have any suggestions? Should I start with a book, read some reference manuals, subscribe to some blogs&#8230;?</p>

<p>There are good books out there, but if you are only interested in some applications, it is easier to look for specific papers. Data Mining is a wide ranging field and studying it all is virtually impossible. For example, most agree that OLAP and data warehousing are a crucial part of Data Mining or at least closely related to it (which begs to question as to how you define &ldquo;Data Mining&rdquo;). Then, you have time series (wavelets, Fourier,&#8230;), machine learning and so on.</p>
