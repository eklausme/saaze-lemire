These guys from Carnegie-Mellon did something that is impressive: extract reliable 3D models from still images. See for yourself:

Since I have not followed advanced in this field, I have no idea how close they are to the state-of-the-art, but I don&rsquo;t care. If these guys were to launch a start-up, I&rsquo;d invest. (If I had any money, that is.)

(This is, by the way, a very good illustration of how video-on-the-Web can be used to promote one&rsquo;s research.)
