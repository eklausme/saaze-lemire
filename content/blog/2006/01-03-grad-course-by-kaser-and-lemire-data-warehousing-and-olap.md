title: "Grad Course by Kaser and Lemire: Data Warehousing and OLAP"
---



For the third time, this term, we are teaching CS6905 Advanced Technologies for E-Business: Data Warehousing and OLAP. The course material is mostly original content gathered from [OLAP and Data Warehousing papers](https://lemire.me/OLAP/). This is probably a unique course and I&rsquo;m very proud of its quality though there is at least one similar course out there offered by Dimitra Vista from Drexel University. Here&rsquo;s the summary:

> On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) aims to accelerate typical queries in large databases or data warehouses so that on-line performance is possible. OLAP constitutes one of the core data-mining technologies used in industry. This section of the course will target the core technology behind OLAP.


This is the second half of a two parts course, the first part is on web services (mostly SOAP-related stuff), but Yuhong has not had time yet to post here new course content but you can check out the 2004 version.

Eventually, I&rsquo;d be interested in either offering the course in Montreal, making a tutorial out of it, or making an online version of it.
