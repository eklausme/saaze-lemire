> (&hellip;) India, which accounts for a quarter of the developing world&rsquo;s population and has the third largest higher education system in the world. Today, 23 percent of all higher education enrollments in India are in distance educationâ€“specifically in 13 national and state open universities and 106 institutions, mostly public, that teach both on campus and by correspondence. The government&rsquo;s target is that by 2010, 40 percent of all higher education participation will take place using distance education.
