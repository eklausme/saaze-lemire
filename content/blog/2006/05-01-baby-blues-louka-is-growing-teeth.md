title: "Baby blues: Louka is growing teeth"
---



Louka kept us up last night. Ok. Louka is irritable. Quite a bit so.

As usual, medical knowledge is useless, all you can learn is this:

> For some babies, teething is painless. Others may experience brief periods of irritability, and some may seem cranky for weeks, experiencing crying episodes and disrupted sleeping and eating patterns. (Source: [kidshealth.org](http://kidshealth.org/parent/general/teeth/teething.html))
