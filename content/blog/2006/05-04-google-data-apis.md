I wish I understood the point of this Google Data APIs.

> The Google data APIs (&ldquo;GData&rdquo; for short) provide a simple standard protocol for reading and writing data on the web. GData combines common XML-based syndication formats (Atom and RSS) with a feed-publishing system based on the Atom publishing protocol, plus some extensions for handling queries.


I&rsquo;m not stupid, I can see how it would be cool to query databases all over the web almost automagically. I can see value in that it would be standardized.

But my little brain has trouble seeing the implications&hellip;
