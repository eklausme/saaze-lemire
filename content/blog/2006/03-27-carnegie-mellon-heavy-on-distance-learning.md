There 4 big CS schools in the USA, Stanford, Berkeley, MIT, and Carnegie-Mellon. How you define &ldquo;big school&rdquo; is left to you, but I&rsquo;m taking the word of the president of the ACM on this. Carnegie-Mellon University offers the [Master in Software Engineering](http://www.distance.cmu.edu/) and the [Master in IT](http://www.msit.cmu.edu/) in distance learning mode. Maybe this says something about how far distance learning has come?
