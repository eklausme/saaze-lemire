title: "Java 6.0 is out"

The [new Java is out](http://java.sun.com/javase/6/webnotes/features.html)! Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but it seems that this is a minor release. Performance has improved, and that is always good, but I could not find any new feature to get me excited. Of course, speed, in itself, is a good feature!

Well, there is one minor feature which might be useful for teaching and in some context: you have the necessary classes to setup a small HTTP server.
