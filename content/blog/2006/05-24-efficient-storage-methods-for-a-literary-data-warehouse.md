ABSTRACT

Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has applications in the
humanities and social sciences. Ever-larger electronic text archives have
the advantage of allowing a more complete analysis but the disadvantage
of forcing longer waits for results. This thesis addresses the issue of
efficiently storing data in a literary data warehouse. The method in which
the data is stored directly influences the ability to extract useful,
analytical results from the data warehouse in a timely fashion.
A variety of storage methods including mapped files, trees, hashing,
and databases are evaluated to determine the most efficient method
of storing cubes in the data warehouse. Each storage method's ability
to insert and retrieve data points as well as slice, dice, and roll-up a
cube is evaluated. The amount of disk space required to store
the cubes is also considered. Five test cubes of various sizes are used to
determine which method being evaluated is most efficient. The results lead
to various storage methods being efficient, depending on properties of the
cube and the requirements of the user.
