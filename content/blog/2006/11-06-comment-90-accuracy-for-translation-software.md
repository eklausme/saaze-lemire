<p>Thanks. I surfed the Bleu paper. Correct me if I&rsquo;m wrong, but there does not seem to have a unique meaning to &ldquo;translate with accuracy of 90%&rdquo;.</p>

<p> A qualified &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, the qualification is a big one, though: the goal isn&rsquo;t to directly use the translations, but to make them available as an intermediate step in human translation.

<p>Yes. My wife is a translator and she already does this. I think most translators already benefit from the pretty good translation software out there. I have not read up on the productivity gains, but according to my wife, while the gains are real, they are not so high as one might think since a lot of the translator&rsquo;s time is spent on &ldquo;problem cases&rdquo; that require research or deep thinking&#8230; and the software does not help with this. Though the Web does! I think most translators would trade automated translation for the Web any time. So maybe we could say that the most powerful translation aid is the Web.</p>
<p>But are you sure everyone understands this? I have read somewhere (maybe slashdot) that American soldiers use translation software on the field to chat with civilians. This suggests that American soldiers don&rsquo;t need interprets and they can just wander along with their software. Hmmm?</p>

<p><i>I&rsquo;m no natural language researcher, but I&rsquo;d be interested in knowing how they measure accuracy.</i></p>

<p>A qualified &lsquo;yes&rsquo;, the qualification is a big one, though: the goal isn&rsquo;t to directly use the translations, but to make them available as an intermediate step in human translation. Good translators are few and far between, and machine translation stands a decent chance of either speeding up there work, or allowing less-fluent people to still produce a reasonable gloss of a document in a reasonable amount of time. </p>
<p>Anecdotally, my French isn&rsquo;t good enough to translate an academic article from scratch, but given a set of 90%-accurate machine translations I could probably make small corrections and choose between alternative translations quite effectively.</p>
