NRC has published [Java clocks](http://time5.nrc.ca/webclock_e.shtml) for those who want to be sure they have, precisely, the right time! Naturally, you can also use their [Network Time Protocol (NTP)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Network_Time_Protocol) server and type:

<code>netdate time.chu.nrc.ca</code>

as root. (This is for Linux machines.)

Windows XP has a builtin NTP client. Go in the control panel, under date/time then &ldquo;Internet time&rdquo;.
