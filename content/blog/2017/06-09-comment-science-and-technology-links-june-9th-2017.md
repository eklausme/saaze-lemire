<p>FYI, from the same nature article regarding trehalose:<br/>
&ldquo;Despite the prospect of a safe and natural sugar as a treatment for cardiovascular disease, we did not observe protection from atherosclerosis with oral-only dosing of trehalose.&rdquo;<br/>
The mice in the experiment were injected.</p>
<p>None of the stuff on Amazon will have any of the protective benefits against cardiovascular diseases..</p>

<p><em>None of the stuff on Amazon will have any of the protective benefits against cardiovascular diseases.</em></p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think we know this to be true but I think that we should expect that the effect (positive or negative) is going to be small.</p>
