<p>Great points, however, it sounds weird that teleconferencing doesn&rsquo;t work for you. Our family&rsquo;s personal experience that nowadays, meeting in person for work-related matters is mostly a waste of time. Video quality isn&rsquo;t always great (although it can be pretty good unless you use Skype), but it is mostly unnecessary. Also, a lot of matters can be resolved in writing (e-mails, ticket systems, etc).</p>

<p>You and I have never met, not even in videoconference. Objectively, we have done great work together. We have been productive. And so forth.</p>
<p>So this supports your point. But you are refering to a context where we don&rsquo;t need videoconferencing in the first place.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve a lot of bad videoconferences this year where I am convinced things did not progress nearly as much as they should have.</p>

<p>Right, I could have mentioned this: we didn&rsquo;t even teleconference.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Great solutions are often based on simple ideas that are executed with care.&rdquo; &#8211; my favorite quote from your post!</p>
<p>I enjoy your posts a lot. I appreciate their conciseness and their informativeness, their lack of fluff and plain common sense. I recently moved (back) to Montreal and am contemplating joining a Tribalab lunch ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I bought a Surface Pro for my daughter, and it&rsquo;s turned out surprisingly well. The killer app for her was drawing with the pen, but the PC features are undiminished.</p>

<p>I was going to get a Surface Pro this year, but this was a group purchase and one colleague did not feel like a Surface Pro could be a reasonable &ldquo;primary device&rdquo;. So I ended up with an XPS 13 which is my primary (Windows) laptop. (I could have insisted on getting a Surface Pro, but the XPS 13 felt like a good purchase.)</p>
<p>I am not a fan of the XPS 13 and, as it turns out, none of my colleagues like it. It is Dell&rsquo;s flagship laptop, but it is not good. It took me forever to find fixes for its bugs. My colleagues gave up, in part because of the bugs.</p>
<p><a href="https://lemire.me/blog/2017/02/16/thoughts-on-my-new-laptop-dell-xps-13-with-windows-10/">I wrote a review of the XPS 13</a>. I can&rsquo;t quite nail it, but I still don&rsquo;t like it.</p>
<p>I should disclose that I have an Apple laptop (a regular macbook) and I am not a fan. The keyboard is something of a catastrophe for me.</p>
<p>I am currently frustrated with all my devices. Would I feel better with the Surface Pro? Maybe. But it does not feel like a good tablet:</p>
<blockquote><p>Ironically, where the Surface Pro 4 falls short is that &ldquo;tablet&rdquo; part, not because of the hardware but as the result of an ecosystem that is light on the kind of apps that make a great tablet. (<a href="https://www.zdnet.com/product/microsoft-surface-pro-4/" rel="nofollow">ZDNet</a>)</p></blockquote>
<p>I am still looking for a great laptop.</p>
<p>Thankfully, I can now say that, in truth, I am happy with all modern operating systems. Things like Windows Vista were just bad. Windows 10 is fine.</p>
