There is a common movie quote where one (often the hero) says to an academic: &ldquo;I have read all of your papers&rdquo;.
This does not happen. If you are an academic and someone says something of the sort, you just know that they are lying to you.

Well. Google has read all of everyone&rsquo;s papers.
