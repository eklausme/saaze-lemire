[Methylene blue rejuvenates old skin](https://eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-05/uom-cac053017.php). You can buy [methylene blue on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Methylene-Blue-General-Prevention-Treatment-Aquarium/dp/B00025646W/) and spray it on your face. It is reportedly safe, even in high concentration. Of course, you are likely to turn blue.

[A school in the UK is offering a degree in eSport](http://www.businessinsider.com/staffordshire-university-launches-britains-first-esports-degree-2017-5) (video games).

[There are 20 CRISPR (gene editing) clinic trials going on right now](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133095-boom-in-human-gene-editing-as-20-crispr-trials-gear-up/).

According to [Bloom et al.](https://web.stanford.edu/~chadj/IdeaPF.pdf), <em>ideas and in particular the exponential growth they imply are getting harder and harder to find</em>.

[Microgravity spurs genetic mutation](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133147-floating-in-microgravity-gives-bacteria-permanent-genetic-boost/).

The US pulled out of the Paris Agreement on climate change. [What does that mean in concrete terms?](https://www.the-american-interest.com/2017/06/01/the-sound-and-fury-of-trumps-paris-pull-out/)

> (&hellip;) since Paris was an entirely voluntary deal, Trump&rsquo;s climate policies weren&rsquo;t constrained in any meaningful way by our participation in it. Conversely, his climate policies won&rsquo;t be substantively different now that we&rsquo;re pulling out of Paris.


[Samsung plans to make processors with 4nm features in 2020](https://semiengineering.com/samsung-unveils-scaling-packaging-roadmaps/). As far as I know, this is half as small as any current processor.

[Solar power is now cheaper than coal power in India](http://www.independent.co.uk/environment/india-solar-power-electricity-cancels-coal-fired-power-stations-record-low-a7751916.html).

The cortex is the part of the brain of mammals that is responsible for most higher-level brain functions. We sometimes lose some of the neurons in the cortex which, if this damage accumulate, can lead to serious cognitive problems. [French researchers have shown that we can replenish these neurons using stem cells](https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.neuron.2015.02.001).

Japan is facing a decade-long period of stagnation, and it is running out of workers. [So it is reportedly moving to legalize drone deliveries by 2020](https://venturebeat.com/2017/05/29/japan-reportedly-to-allow-drone-deliveries-in-2020-self-driving-trucks-in-2022/).

[Some company claims that the blood plasma from young people can rejuvenate older people](https://www.newscientist.com/article/2133311-human-tests-suggest-young-blood-cuts-cancer-and-alzheimers-risk/). This seems highly speculative and I would not recommend you try it. I would bet that the results are wrong. I am sure we can rejuvenate old human beings, but probably not through plasma transfusions.
