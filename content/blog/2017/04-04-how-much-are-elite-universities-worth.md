Will you do better if you attend a selective college?

If you are Caucasian (white) and from a middle class or better background&hellip; you will not: &ldquo;Our estimates of the return to college selectivity (&hellip;) are generally indistinguishable from zero&rdquo; ([Dale and Krueger, 2014](http://www.nber.org/papers/w17159))

It is important to keep the facts straight. Kids who attend college, especially elite colleges, tend to have an excellent background and to be quite smart. So we know that they will do well. But they won&rsquo;t do better if they have the name of an elite college on their resume. Having the ambition and the grades to get into an elite school is enough.
