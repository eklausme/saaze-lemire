Elon Musk, [Making Humans a Multi-Planetary Species](https://doi.org/10.1089/space.2017.29009.emu), New Space. June 2017, 5(2): 46-61.

Reportedly, [Ikea is working on augmented reality software](https://www.macrumors.com/2017/06/19/ikea-plans-furniture-app-arkit/) that would allow you to see the furniture in your home before buying it.

Current virtual reality headsets provide a good experience, but if you ever tried to read text while where one of the headsets, you may have noticed that it is quite hard. It seems that it is because the image resolution is too low. [When using prototypes with very high resolution, you can &ldquo;read text across the room&rdquo;.](https://vrscout.com/news/view-xr-varjo-worlds-first-human-eye-resolution-headset/)

You would think that a tree that is over 200 years old would have accumulated a lot of (random) genetic mutations. However, it seems that it is not the case: [as trees grow old, even very old, they preserve their genes intact](http://www.nature.com/news/ancient-oak-s-youthful-genome-surprises-biologists-1.22166). We do not know why or how.
