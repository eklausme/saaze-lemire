<p>I&rsquo;m a big McSherry fan, although I&rsquo;m in also in favor of people who point out that running a graph algo in SQL is often OK. </p>
<p>He&rsquo;s right that the costs of choosing a bad architecture are both persistent and widely ignored. Map-reduce isn&rsquo;t just a dog in the lab; large companies spend billions mapping and remapping the same data over and over, as well as building their workflows around the sluggish batch processes that result.</p>

<p>Frank McSherry&rsquo;s blog is an eye-opener (any way we can make it required reading for all CS PhD programs? At least for database-systems students). I happened to be reading the SIGMOD &ldquo;all in one&rdquo; paper recently and was totally confused as to how a general purpose mechanism (relational database) could beat or match a purpose-specific (graph database) one. No, it shouldn&rsquo;t happen -at the very least, because most graph algorithms are not expressible in SQL; they require one to wrap queries in some form of loop, and that usually adds quite a bit of overhead (related question: does anyone use the recursive capabilities of SQL on real-life data?). As I said, this should be required reading.</p>
