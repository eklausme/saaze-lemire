<p>I cannot help but draw parallels to population genetics; the conservation of mutations through forces such as purifying selection, whilst a population tinkers at perhaps an arguably &ldquo;fairly low intensity&rdquo; through the processes of spontaneous mutation and recombination, giving it a diversity that serves as a template for future avenues (i.e. &ldquo;robustness&rdquo; loosely speaking). The push and pull of conservatism versus progressivism are certainly at play in evolution.</p>
