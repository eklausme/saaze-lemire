<p>Â Â  Thanks very much for the link to the fascinating article by Rekdal on academic carelessness and the &ldquo;debunking of spinach debunking&rdquo; (or something like that).Â  I was only disappointed NOT to find out who generated the myth in the first place &#8211; I guess that&rsquo;s lost in the mists of time.<br/>
Â Â  I&rsquo;ll continue eating spinach in any case &#8212;</p>

<p>Interesting that the melatonin article seems to argue the mechanism of action is direct. I would have assumed that it was merely improving sleep, which was yielding the neurological benefits. I still wonder if the common theme in a lot of these aging studies is acting by improving sleep, and if controlling for sleep would eliminate the effect; this study isn&rsquo;t clear in that point.</p>
