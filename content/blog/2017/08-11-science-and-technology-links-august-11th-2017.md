It looks like the Java programming language might finally get [in-language support for vector instructions](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LGVxiDxIrFM), these instructions are supported by modern processors and multiply the processing speed&hellip; but they often require different algorithms. Language designers have often ignored vector instructions, relying instead on optimizing compilers to &ldquo;auto-vectorize&rdquo; the code. Optimizing compilers are very good, but experience shows that language support for performance features pays.

It seems that armies worldwide are toying with the idea of[ smart full face military helmets](http://nypost.com/2017/08/02/special-forces-test-out-boba-fett-combat-helmet/). These helmets are bullet proof, have night vision and heat detection, they offer augmented reality. Sounds like something from Star Wars.

Whey is a common byproduct of the transformation of milk. It is cheap. Bodybuilders use whey protein supplements to grow bigger muscles. [It seems that supplementing with whey proteins might be a good strategy for all of us](https://www.worldhealth.net/news/new-supplement-repairs-and-rejuvenates-older-adults-muscles/), young and old. Personally, I remain somewhat cautious. We don&rsquo;t know the long term effects of loading up on proteins. It is a popular thing to do, but it does not make it safe.

Parkinson&rsquo;s is a terrible disease that cannot be stopped or even slowed currently. A diabetes drug called [exenatide appeared to have halted the progression of disease in a small trial](http://www.bbc.com/news/health-40814250). If this could be verified, it would be a historical event.
