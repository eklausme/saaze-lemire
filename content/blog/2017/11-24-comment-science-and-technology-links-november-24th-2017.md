<p>&gt; I have always been fascinated by how poor synthesized speech sounds.</p>
<p>Same, to the point of occasionally exploring what the start-up situation looks like and whether there&rsquo;s something worth doing to fix it. High-quality voice synthesis would, I think, change the economics for producing things like video games and possibly some television (animated shows coming to mind), particularly more &ldquo;indie&rdquo; work. Perhaps we wind up in a time where the human voice actor is replaced with someone that can create unique vocal styles for virtual characters.</p>
