<p>I have taken methylene blue internally. Good to see another study suggesting it is good for you. I don&rsquo;t recommend spraying it in your face. Your face will be stained blue for a while.</p>
<p>But a drop in a glass of water three times a day for three days seems okay. It is a stimulant, and it also probably kills gut bacteria. Might be an MAO inhibitor too, if I remember correctly. That&rsquo;s why I limit it. I&rsquo;ve heard of people taking a lot more in the hopes of solving various problems. so I feel downright reasonable rather than crazy internet experimenter.<br/>
I&rsquo;ve also heard of some of the nootropic types using dosages much lower than mine- like stretching out one drop over a month or more, because there are apparent some mental benefits at that level too.</p>

<p>&#8230; which could be a feature. </p>
<p><em>I feel downright reasonable rather than crazy internet experimenter</em></p>
<p>I joke about it, but I don&rsquo;t actually mock people who would take it.</p>
<p>Of course, you are taking a risk but it is not like you are going to live forever while doing nothing.</p>
