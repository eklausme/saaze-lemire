<p>What if I say that those smart machines will make man more intelligent and have longer life. And man being more intelligent in turn create more smarter machines that make man to become much more intelligent. And the cycle is repeated exponentially. We now have advanced stem cells research. We are exploring and recording DNAs functions. We have advanced in nano-technology. All these with the help of machines. Machines cannot replace human beings. Perhaps time will come when human beings will no longer be needing machines.</p>
