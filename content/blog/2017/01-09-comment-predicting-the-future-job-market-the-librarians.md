<p>I agree with you, Daniel. Most of the claims like &ldquo;robots will take all of jobs&rdquo; are completely overblown.</p>
<p>Sure, the job market will certainly change. But has it ever stopped changing anyways? Many jobs that were essential back in the day simply aren&rsquo;t so today. We just need to think about milk and bread delivery; it was hot in the 50s and 60s, but not anymore. Do we really need these anymore?</p>
<p>Jobs that can be automated will probably disappear. And those that can&rsquo;t be simply won&rsquo;t. It will be our responsibility to adapt this changing landscape. And we may have some surprises; jobs that we thought would disappear may not, like librarians.</p>
