<p>Interesting. I hadn&rsquo;t heard of this film. Searching online, there seems to be a lot of criticism regarding its alleged &ldquo;whitewashing&rdquo;. For example: <a href="http://mashable.com/2017/04/03/ghost-in-the-shell-movie-ending/#6qdVmJcl6qqK" rel="nofollow ugc">http://mashable.com/2017/04/03/ghost-in-the-shell-movie-ending/#6qdVmJcl6qqK</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m fascinated by cases where a poorly reviewed movie is actually good, or even excellent, by my or others&rsquo; standards. Sometimes I wonder about a mismatch between the culture of urban film reviewers and those of various movie audiences, or differences in people&rsquo;s philosophy of art. I&rsquo;ll probably see this movie. Scarlett seems to be doing well.</p>
