<p>Since you said that you know a lot of people with joint pains, might i recommend orthopaedic footwear? ðŸ™‚ My mom used to get a lot of ankle pains (though not technically knee pains) and after she started using these footwear her pains have come down by 90%. </p>
<p>Worth a shot!</p>
<p>I would like to suggest that if they decide to buy, they buy the most expensive available because lower cost ones are usually not properly designed and could actually make the pains worse.</p>
