<p>Linux is not a niche player in everything but servers, but yes, Linux owns the server market in overwhelming fashion.</p>
<p>Linux owns more than half the phone mobile market with Android (a version of linux).</p>
<p>Linux owns the educational computer market in the USA and elsewhere, with ChromeOS (a version of Linux).</p>
<p>Linux owns the IoT space hands down.</p>
<p>Linux owns most current embedded development.</p>
<p>So is this a niche player? Linux owns every niche besides the desktop. Perhaps desktop is a niche?</p>

<p>(I should disclose that I am very favorable to Linux.)</p>
<p><em>Linux is not a niche player in everything but servers, but yes, Linux owns the server market in overwhelming fashion.</em></p>
<p>Linux is used by about a third of all websites&#8230;</p>

<p>The Linux kernel is used by Android and Chrome OS, but that&rsquo;s not exactly the same as what was meant by Linux in the early 2000s.</p>
<p>I mean&#8230; ultimately, many of the modern web browsers are derived from Konqueror, the early KDE web browser&#8230; but we don&rsquo;t say that Konqueror won the browser war.</p>
<p><em>So is this a niche player? Linux owns every niche besides the desktop. Perhaps desktop is a niche?</em></p>
<p>I think that most people who have Android phones don&rsquo;t consider themselves Linux users. And we do not commonly refer to Android as &ldquo;Linux&rdquo;.</p>
<p>To this day, it is hard to order a Linux box. I order Linux servers from Dell every year, and we usually end up installing Linux ourselves.</p>

<p>As for seeing this coming &#8211; in the 90s I foresaw the eventual success of open source.

<p>I stated early on that MS would be better off as an OS company and an applications company &#8211; so the applications company could write apps for MacOS and Linux as well as windows &#8211; extending MS reach, and the OS company could more readily muck around in new spaces such as mobile and embedded.</p>
<p>That didn&rsquo;t happen, and the rest is history.</p>

<p><em>As for seeing this coming â€“ in the 90s I foresaw the eventual success of open source. I predicted it a little too early, but I did foresee the collapse of Microsoft&rsquo;s monopoly due to the inroads of open source. First it was servers, then Apple used BSD as the basis of their new OS (BSD is open source).</em></p>
<p>It is a bit of a mixed story though, isn&rsquo;t it?</p>
<p>Mac OS X and iOS are not exactly open source. Nor is Android or Chrome OS. And how many apps in the various App stores are open source?</p>
<p>In retrospect, I think it is less of an &ldquo;open source&rdquo; vs. Microsoft story&#8230; and more of a &ldquo;PC&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;non-PC&rdquo; story. PCs are losing ground&#8230; and that&rsquo;s what threatening Microsoft.</p>
<p><em>I stated early on that MS would be better off as an OS company and an applications company â€“ so the applications company could write apps for MacOS and Linux as well as windows â€“ extending MS reach, and the OS company could more readily muck around in new spaces such as mobile and embedded. That didn&rsquo;t happen, and the rest is history.</em></p>
<p>The application market for MacOS and Linux is tiny, to this day.</p>

<p>Your title should read &rdquo; Don&rsquo;t beat them, make them less relevant &rdquo; &#8212; not irrelevant. There is a difference, right ?</p>

<p>Well, at least Linus Torvalds seems to be happy with Android&rsquo;s dominance and the fact that the same kernel powers phones to supercomputers.</p>
<p>&gt;&gt; When Apple launched the iPhone, they were not trying to disrupt the Wintel fortress</p>
<p>Paul Graham also wrote about something similar in his essay &ldquo;What Microsoft Is This The Altair Basic Of&rdquo;. Bill Gates didn&rsquo;t start out writing an operating system that was going to dominate the market. He was writing a Basic interpreter for the Altair.<br/>
