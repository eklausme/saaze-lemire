title: "Virtual Reality: First impressions with the HTC Vive"
---



I just got my hands on some virtual-reality (VR) goggles. Specifically, we have an &ldquo;[HTC Vive](http://www.htcvive.com/ca/)&ldquo;. We are still in the early days of VR and given that these goggles cost about a $1000, not everyone will get to try them outside a demo room. I thought I&rsquo;d share my impressions.
- There are indications that the HTC Vive needs a powerful PC. Because I am disorganized, I ended up with the HTC Vive goggles, but no corresponding powerful gaming PC. So I used what I had: my son&rsquo;s gaming PC. A 5-year-old box. It fails to meet the &ldquo;minimum&rdquo; requirements set by HTC, but at no point did we ever encounter any performance problem. To be fair, I did not try to run any demanding game&hellip; simply because I have none to test&hellip; Still, it seems to me that the belief that VR requires very powerful machines might be overstated.- The HTC hardware is fantastic. It looks good and it is sturdy. I am sure that it will all look ridiculous in a few years, but it is quite usable today. It feels good. The HTC Vive comes with two great controllers.- Setting up the HTC Vive is a bit harder than just putting on the goggles. You need to setup a room with sensors at each end. Still, it is no big deal. The only annoying hardware issue we got was pairing the controllers with the system. It was a source of confusion. The hardest part was finding out where to click to pair the controller.- &hellip; which brings me to the software. The software is a bit flaky like most software tends to be. It looks good and it generally works, but once the server stopped responding and we had to &ldquo;kill it&rdquo; and another time, the demo would insist that we press the &ldquo;system&rdquo; keys whereas doing so never worked. Even so, the software is quite good already.
- So how is the experience? Great. It simply works. Every demo I tried was convincing. It is just like I imagined it. Better than I imagined it in fact because my previous encounters (years ago) with VR were unconvincing.


So where do I see this going in the next couple of years?

- The hardware is basically good enough. I am sure I will sound like a fool in five years when the current VR hardware looks obsolete, but I do not expect it to get a whole lot better, qualitatively speaking. What I do expect is that we will get cheaper versions that work nearly as well. Already, the upcoming [Sony PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-vr/) is going to cost half as much as an HTC Vive.- Content is a problem right now. That is, you can get the goggles working, but you are left feeling that there ought to be something more interesting to do with them&hellip; What I hope we will see is an explosion of new applications and games.


What is next for me? I am getting a [Sony PlayStation VR](https://www.playstation.com/en-ca/explore/playstation-vr/) for my home. I was still slightly on the fence, but playing with the HTC Vive convinced me that the hardware was mature enough.

In time, I want to setup the HTC Vive so that I can program my own prototypes. As a scientist and engineer, I want to find out what else I can do with these goggles.
