title: "Update to my VR bet with Greg Linden"
---



I have an [ongoing bet](http://glinden.blogspot.ca/2016/03/virtual-reality-hitting-mainstream-next.html) with Greg Linden stating that we are going to sell 10 million virtual-reality (VR) units per year by 2019.

I have been paying close attention to VR technology and its impact.

What have we learned in the last few months?

- The technology is fantastic. VR headsets work.
- The software is currently the weak point. Besides games and &ldquo;experiences&rdquo;, we simply have no compelling application. And while there are some good games, none of them is good enough to motivate millions into purchasing a VR headset. 
- A nice surprise: Sony has managed to make VR work with the relatively underpowered PlayStation 4. The initial reports are very positive. I think that&rsquo;s important: it shows that relatively weak and inexpensive processors are sufficient for VR.


I key indicator is how many VR headsets Sony manages to sell over Christmas.
