<p>Telomeres don&rsquo;t necessarily shorten as you age, normally the enzyme telomerase compensates for the shortening. Only if you live unhealthy (smoking, eating bad food, &#8230;) the telomerase can&rsquo;t function properly, and telomeres will shorten.<br/>
See how Elizabeth Blackburn explains it: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lNR1xZS5GY" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-lNR1xZS5GY</a> (part 3 of a lecture, but she starts with a summary of part 1 and 2 where she says what I said here).</p>

<p>Telomeres tend to shorten as you age whether you live a good life or not. Nowhere does Blackburn claim that they do not shorten. </p>
<p>However, she explains at length that stressors can accelerate their shortening. The point that she is hinting at is that telomere shortening might be a consequence, rather than a cause, of diseases.</p>
<p>To put it differently, poor lifestyle can accelerate aging, as measured by telomere length. In these cases, the telomere length is a consequence of aging, and not the cause.</p>
<p>But&#8230;</p>
<p>The video is from 2012. There is has been quite a bit of research since then. Last year, in vitro, we were able to show that resetting the telomeres in stem cells effectively rejuvenate them.</p>
<p>So, in vitro, for individual stem cells, telomere length is a powerful epigenetic clock.</p>
<p>It does seem therefore that telomere length could act both as a cause and a consequence of aging. Maybe.</p>
