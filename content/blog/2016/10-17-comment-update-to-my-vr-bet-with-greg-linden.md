<p>Yep. Pretty much agree with this. Hardware is adequate (though bulky and expensive). Software is missing. Very compelling applications that would justify the cost missing, though games, porn, and education are potentially big ones. That&rsquo;s pretty close to what the Ars article (<a href="http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/best-vr-headset-2016-psvr-rift-vive/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://arstechnica.com/gaming/2016/10/best-vr-headset-2016-psvr-rift-vive/</a>) said too.</p>
<p>The bet still could go either way from what I&rsquo;m seeing. I lean toward my direction &#8212; that it won&rsquo;t make it by 2019 &#8212; but it&rsquo;s definitely got a chance of going either way. In that sense, it was a fun bet to make, definitely a good contest.</p>

<p>Right. I also would not say that I am winning&#8230; and there are definitively many things going your way&#8230; but there are a few factors that are in my favor as well, mostly on the hardware side. As I stress in my blog post, the good reviews that the relatively inexpensive PS VR got are very encouraging. For a time, it looked like the hardware &ldquo;had to&rdquo; be expensive. I did not take for granted that Sony could pull it off&#8230; many people were skeptical that the PS4 was &ldquo;powerful enough&rdquo; for VR. It seems that it is. Also, AMD came up with cards in the $200 range that are perfectly adequate for even the HTC Vive.</p>

<p>Definitely agree with everything you&rsquo;re saying. I&rsquo;d add that the Google Pixel phone (<a href="https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://vr.google.com/daydream/phones/</a>) is a very interesting addition, doubling down on Google Cardboard, but in a way that&rsquo;s quite clever. Great point too on the PS4 and the possibilities that this might be an add on to consoles (like the Kinect was).</p>
