title: "Beyond the PC toward virtual and augmented reality"
---



PC sales have entered a slow decline. Today, you can literally work on your Microsoft Office documents no matter where you are, no matter what computing device you have.

Predicting the short-term future is easy: the next smartphones will be more powerful. The laptops will look more and more like tablets.

For a living, I write software&hellip; this used to require powerful PCs with large monitors. Today I get most of my work done on an ultrathin laptop with a relatively weak processor. I have more pixels than my dual-monitor setup from 15 years ago and a lot of extra computing power.

But using a laptop in 2016 feels antiquated. No matter how good my monitor gets, it is still a dumb flat piece of plastic. You can add a touch interface, but that&rsquo;s at best a minor benefit. Still&hellip; programming on a tablet is not really possible.

So what is the future?

The PC is dying. Even Microsoft has accepted that. Tablets and smartphones are nice, but they can&rsquo;t fully replace PCs.

What will?

I think that virtual reality (VR) and, ultimately, augmented reality (AR) is the answer. Imagine getting in your office, putting on your glasses and &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; not only the silly windows that your monitor currently shows you but a whole interactive interface that surrounds you.

Want to stand up and stretch your legs? Your work can follow you around.

Think I am crazy? [Virtual Desktop](http://www.vrdesktop.net/) is a working prototype of this idea that allows you to operate Windows using a VR system.

I don&rsquo;t think I will be able to trade my laptop for a VR system this year, or even the year after that. There are significant hurdles to overcome.

- Operating systems and applications are designed for PCs or mobile devices. Without VR-aware application and operating systems, we cannot hope for productive work.
- The current VR hardware is maybe well suited to games, but probably not to office work. We need goggles that we can wear for hours, we need the equivalent of a usable keyboard. The screen resolution of the current VR systems might be too low for productive work.


How long before we can overcome these obstacles? I cannot tell, but I also cannot imagine how we could possibly continue indefinitely with laptops. As PC sales continue to fall, there is a strong incentive for entrepreneurs to offer us the next big thing. Billions of dollars stand in the balance.
