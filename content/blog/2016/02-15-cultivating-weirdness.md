title: "Cultivating weirdness"
---



The simplest and safest way to live your life is by cultivating &ldquo;sameness&rdquo;. Look around at what successful people do, and do the same thing. All your cool friends go to college? Go to college. They all work in a start-up? Work in a start-up. All your middle-age friends take up Pilates, take up Pilates.

At an individual level, this works remarkably well. Play it safe. Do what others do&hellip; and I can always guarantee a comfortable middle-class existence.

There is an alternative to cultivating sameness and that&rsquo;s cultivating weirdness. This is slightly different from cultivating &ldquo;your weirdness&rdquo;. I could wear a funny hat. That would get me attention. But my purpose in cultivating weirdness is not to &ldquo;look different&rdquo; but rather to &ldquo;think different&rdquo; (as Apple liked to say). Cultivating weirdness is not the same as joining an &ldquo;alternative scene&rdquo;. That would be another instance of &ldquo;sameness&rdquo;.

On social media, instead of following just people who think like me&hellip; I avoid people who think like me. Instead, I seek extremists in all directions. This means that, yes, I do end up reading for hours people who take the bible literally. I am routinely exposed to people who are openly white supremacists.
I also try to be slightly out-of-sync, but with a purpose. Is gardening out-of-fashion? Interesting. Let me be a gardener. Is everyone wearing a smartphone? Interesting. Let me go without a smartphone.
This way of life is terribly inefficient. That&rsquo;s because accepted ideas are much more likely to be useful than weird ideas. But my goal is not to be right. What I hope to provide is a critical reflection. In other words, I don&rsquo;t mind being wrong as long as I am wrong in an interesting way.
