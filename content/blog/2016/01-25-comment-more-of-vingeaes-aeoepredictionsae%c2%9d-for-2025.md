<p>In Rainbows End, the reason for the protests/objection to the &ldquo;Librariome Project&rdquo; was because the book digitalizations were being done destructively. Whole libraries were being tossed, en mass, into shredders and the pages scanned as they were lofted into the air. The reason implied was it was more cost effective than scanning all the books serially/non-destructively. There was no objection to digitalization per se.</p>

<p>Yes. That&rsquo;s correct. Once more Vinge was being pessimistic: we know that it is cost-effective to digitalize books non-destructively. </p>
<p>The general threat was still that one company would &ldquo;own&rdquo; all the digitalized data and have the first take at it. As far as I can tell, nobody was concerned by that outside the novel. The actual objection we got was that Google was violating copyright.</p>
<p>In the end, the digitalization process is going slowly but not because people are fighting it or because it is expensive, but rather, I expect, because there is little financial value in it.</p>

<p>Some author said trying to get rich by writing books is like trying to get rich by buying lottery tickets. Don&rsquo;t most authors these days (except for the likes of JK Rowling) treat writing books as vanity projects?</p>
<p>I have the Kindle app installed on my phone but I&rsquo;m not willing to pay more than a few dollars on a book that I&rsquo;d be (somewhat) interested in reading. If it&rsquo;s more expensive than that, I simply look for alternatives (e.g. articles/podcasts/lectures by the same author, Wikipedia entries on the same topic, etc).</p>
<p>Most people these days probably consider books something they can live without, as they are lots of alternative entertainment &amp; education options, like Wikipedia (as you mention), YouTube and Netflix. They generate far more value for people than books, old or new, in my opinion.</p>

<p>Writing above reminded me of the interview Vice had with Cody Wilson (the guy who made the schema for 3D printed guns available online):</p>

<p>He talks about the academica&rsquo;s fixation on books (rather than, say, TV shows). I&rsquo;d love to hear your thoughts on this topic.</p>
