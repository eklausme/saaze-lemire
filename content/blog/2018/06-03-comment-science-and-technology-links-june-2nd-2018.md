<p>Conclusion: Humans are terribly irrational. Actually they are programmed for antiquity. Anyway Jurgen Schmidhuber has a dream of constructing replacements.<br/>

<p>Apparently, buying your way into an &ldquo;Ivy League&rdquo; school has always been a bit of an open secret. Also students from wealth are graded on a curve (as in it is almost impossible to fail). Some (all?) of the Ivy League schools give out &ldquo;honors&rdquo; liberally, in essence to students who actually do the assigned work.</p>
<p>To maintain the myth that only the &ldquo;best&rdquo; go to the Ivy League, those schools have to aggressively recruit a portion of very bright students (without wealth) so that some meaningful work is done by graduates.</p>
<p>I only thought to ask the question a couple years ago. The answers are easy to find. Seems this has always been only a semi-secret. Which makes sense, as the schools market to the newly-wealthy.</p>
<p>All of which paints a picture of our current President. He went to Wharton, which at the time was a least-reputable Ivy League school. He could not get admitted, until his older brother arrived (presumably with a bigger checkbook). He did not get honors.</p>
<p>And this rich idiot now leads the most-powerful country on Earth.</p>
