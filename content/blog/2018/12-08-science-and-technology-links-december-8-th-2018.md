1. The energy density of lithium-ion batteries doubled between 1995 and 2005 but [only increased by about 15% between 2005 and 2015](https://www.greentechmedia.com/articles/read/has-li-ion-reached-the-point-of-diminishing-returns#gs.PkUpTYo). It is estimated that there is relatively little further gains in energy density possible with lithium-ion batteries. However, our mobile devices typically consume far less power than they did only a few years ago while offering faster processing.
1. In China, [78% of all research institutes focus on science and engineering](https://scholarlykitchen.sspnet.org/2018/12/03/guest-post-the-academic-market-in-china-an-overview/), and only 12% focus on the humanities. A quarter of the top universities have a science and engineering focus.
1. In the US, [if I know your zip code, your gender and your birthdate, I can nearly uniquely identify you](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/2018/12/07/simulating-zipcode-sex-birthdate/).
1. In wealthy countries, [happier people are more likely to have children](https://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0206202).
1. It is sometimes stated that beyond physical differences, the brains of men and women are identical. [Rosenblatt (2016) disagrees](https://www.pnas.org/content/113/14/E1966): &ldquo;Brains are indeed typically male or typically female.&rdquo; [Falk and Hermle (2018) further observe](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/362/6412/eaas9899) that the more that women have equal opportunities, the more they differ from men in their preferences. [Zhang et al. (2018) have a related finding](https://psyarxiv.com/mtsx8):<br/>

> On average, women show stronger preferences for mates with good earning capacity than men do, while men show stronger preferences for physically attractive mates than women do (&hellip;) we found little evidence that these sex differences were smaller in countries with greater gender equality.

1. It seems that [very large mammals co-existed with the dinosaurs](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smart-news/elephant-size-mammal-cousin-mingled-dinosaurs-180970886/).
