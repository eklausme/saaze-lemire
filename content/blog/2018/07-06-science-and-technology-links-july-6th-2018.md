1. In the United Kingdom, only a tiny minority of high school female students take computer science ([0.4% in 2017](https://assets.publishing.service.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/676389/SFR03_2018_Main_text.pdf)). Physics is ten times more popular.
1. [Russians once drilled a 12-km deep hole](https://www.smithsonianmag.com/smithsonian-institution/ask-smithsonian-whats-deepest-hole-ever-dug-180954349/). Apparently, it gets very hot as you dig deeper.
1. [Deep neural networks can detect myocardial infarction in electrocardiography (ECG) better than the state-of-the-art](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1806.07385.pdf). In clear: artificial intelligent can find out whether you are having a heart attack with high accuracy, assuming that you are wearing the right sensors. 
1. [Drinking coffee, even lots of it, is good for you](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamainternalmedicine/article-abstract/2686145).
1. [Every year, more and more research papers are made freely available online](https://poeticeconomics.blogspot.com/2018/07/dramatic-growth-of-open-access-june-2018.html). Sadly, in most fields, it is still a tiny minority of the published research. The net result is that if you are not affiliated with a university, it is hard to have access to the latest research. 
1. [Spiders can fly over long distances](http://journals.plos.org/plosbiology/article?id=10.1371/journal.pbio.2004405).
1. [Aspirin might help keep Alzheimer&rsquo;s at bay (speculative)](http://www.jneurosci.org/content/early/2018/07/02/JNEUROSCI.0054-18.2018)
1. [Viruses might trigger Alzheimer&rsquo;s (speculative)](https://www.cell.com/neuron/fulltext/S0896-6273(18)30421-5?_returnURL=https%3A%2F%2Flinkinghub.elsevier.com%2Fretrieve%2Fpii%2FS0896627318304215%3Fshowall%3Dtrue).
1. [Stem cells helped a bit to improve the outcome after a heart attack in macaque monkeys](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4162).
