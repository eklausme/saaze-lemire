<p>In practice, there remains a lot that can be done with respect to network latency. Real world web sites have huge latency due to a complicated collection of factors. The most significant of these (I believe) is the sheer number of &ldquo;outsourced&rdquo; connections required to complete a page, couple with the inability of the browser to reasonably render the page until many key pieces of media have been fetched.</p>
<p>One can take a typical commercial website that takes in excess of 5 seconds to load (far from uncommon), and by the simple adding of dimensions to its all images make it present all its text in under a second, <em>with no need to redraw</em> once the images started loading.</p>
