<p>Have you tried any A/B tests with a non-VR version? My money is on the non-VR version. The problem with VR doesn&rsquo;t seem to be technical feasibility but the lack of any killer app.</p>

<p>We have not done user testing (yet).</p>
<p>I agree that we lack killer apps&#8230; but these need to be built by people&#8230; they don&rsquo;t grow on trees&#8230; and you need to cross the technical threshold for them to be possible&#8230; we are getting there technically&#8230; so it is time to work on the apps!</p>
<p>Regarding testing&#8230; I don&rsquo;t think it is so easy to do something like A/B testing. These are really different artefacts. It is nothing like just changing the layout.</p>
<p>Finally, before you conclude on a pessimistic tone, I&rsquo;d really like you to get into a headset and try our demos. If you are in Montreal, ping me!</p>
