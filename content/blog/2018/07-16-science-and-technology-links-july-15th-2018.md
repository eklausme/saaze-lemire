1. Senescent cells are old cells that refuse to die; they are behind several age-related diseases. We know how to clear them, at least in part. <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41591-018-0092-9">If we inject even few senescent cells in mice, they suffer. Clearing the senescent cells afterward rescues the mice.<br/>
