<p>&ldquo;Our world in data&rdquo; recently published an article on <a href="https://ourworldindata.org/why-do-women-live-longer-than-men" rel="nofollow">why women live longer than men</a> and how the difference has changed recently. In the 1800s, there was almost no difference; this increased last century; and now the difference is decreasing again. The causes for the gap are not fully known, but are biological, behavioral, and environmental.</p>
<p>Probably one of the biggest reasons for the large difference between men and women during the last century was that men smoked more than women.</p>
