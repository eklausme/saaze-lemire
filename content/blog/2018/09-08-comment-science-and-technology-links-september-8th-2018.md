<p>Nothing gives confidence in the increased testosterone levels claim quite like &ldquo;and other important benefits&rdquo;, left vague and unspecified&#8230;</p>
<p>I strongly suspect that those &ldquo;other important benefits&rdquo; are the supposed joys of increased sexual desire. Cephalus (or perhaps Sophocles, Socrates, or perhaps Plato) states this outright on page 1 of The Republic: &ldquo;How well I remember the aged poet Sophocles, when in answer to the question, How does love suit with age, Sophocles, &#8211;are you still the man you were? Peace, he replied; most gladly have I escaped the thing of which you speak; I feel as if I had escaped from a mad and furious master. &rdquo;</p>
<p>But there is money to be made in persuading people to go back to being slaves, to pay to have that mad and furious master once more control them. The fact that the US medical profession (I don&rsquo;t know what it&rsquo;s like in other countries, but it&rsquo;s certainly this way in the US, across a variety of doctors of both sexes) is so insistent that the waning of sex drive with age is a problem, not a benefit, of growing old, is exhibit A in &ldquo;why medicine knows many facts, but very little wisdom&rdquo;.</p>
<p>So that&rsquo;s your choice. Listen to the guys who will happily sell you both testosterone and then viagra (and, what the hell, also a sports car and anything else you might feel you need, once you&rsquo;re upset that you still can&rsquo;t relive your twenties) OR listen to the wisdom of the ages and enjoy the fact that one fewer irrational masters now controls you.</p>

<p>@1 It doesn&rsquo;t sound very strict to me limiting access to information for economic gain puts those in less developed, i.e the majority of the world population, back and limits their potential development. It sustains and increases the gap between the well-of and the not so well-of, i.e. we make the rich richer and the poor poorer. This is what rich people tend to do, the majority of US policy makers and decision makers (Congress and the Senate) are multi-millionaires if not billionaires, how can we ever expect a fair and just society. that also reflects on the poor (and expensive) health-care system in the US, the rich just helicopter themselves from the gated community to the private clinic. The research, particularly in the EU, is funded with public money, the researchers have a job, because they are paid by tax-payers, the publications should (and will) be freely available (or libgen.io), software patents (the hazard pointers patent will be running out soon ðŸ™‚ ) is another (US) abomination.</p>
<p>@7 It&rsquo;s all about &ldquo;let&rsquo;s sue the doctor&rdquo; climate in the US, the doctor takes risk insurance (for alleged malpractice) and just passes on the cost to the clients/patients. In the UK you will not get treatment if you do not sign (before an operation f.e.) a paper stating that you know things could go wrong and that you accept that risk. The source does not have a link to it.</p>
<p>@8 If you don&rsquo;t care about the environment, drive cars that are highly inefficient, bulky and have 20th century tech (except Tesla of course), what does one expect. Money, money, money, the poor pay the price.</p>
