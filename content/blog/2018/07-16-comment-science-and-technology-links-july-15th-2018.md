<p>As to (1), the numbers are for just England and Wales. To normalize the chart, we would need to know the relative number of folk in each bucket. Put differently, are there a lot of old folk in that area?</p>
<p>Also the size in age is different for each bucket. All the brackets are five years, except the 80+ bracket. Skews the result?</p>
<p>It is worth knowing the absolute numbers, perhaps for setting regional policy. As a selfish individual, I want a normalized number. In particular, what are the odds of dying per individual per year, for each of the brackets.</p>
<p>Of course then I would like to know how those absolute and normalized numbers vary from one region to another, and how they vary across time.</p>
<p>Easy to get mislead into dubious conclusions.</p>

<p>England and Wales is a vast region. Millions and millions of folks. The age distributions are available, but they are not, to my knowledge, particularly intriguing.</p>
<p>The United States has a younger population and a higher death rate, so the same exact result might not hold across all of the USA, but you can bet good money that it holds over specific regions (e.g., many states).</p>
