<p>The solar panel energy balance point appears to have tipped around 2010-4, and the early deficit may be &lsquo;paid off&rsquo; by 2020: <a href="http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3038824" rel="nofollow ugc">http://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/es3038824</a></p>
<p>OK that&rsquo;s only one paper, but surely better than a single highly tendentious &amp; unsubstantiated tweet (isn&rsquo;t uncritical quoting of those how &lsquo;fake news&rsquo; spreads?)</p>
<p>(Admittedly Izabella Kaminska&rsquo;s wider point is clearly correct)</p>

<p>Right, except that I also quote Tyler Cowen who provided a lot more than a tweet.</p>

<p>This quote is grossly inaccurate:<br/>
&ldquo;You still have to burn more energy creating solar panels than solar panels can give back in a useful lifetime.&rdquo;</p>
<p>From this Nature article(1), the energy payback times are &lsquo;under 1 year for poly-Si and just over 1 year for mono-Si PV systems currently&rsquo;. </p>
<p>From this NREL study(2), in North America, you should be able to get 25 years of energy out of a solar panel. </p>
<p>Of course, everybody&rsquo;s an expert on Twitter, so what do I know?</p>

<p>Tyler Cowan is well known for publishing outlandish claims from the far right, and should always be fact-checked.</p>
<p>The solar panel myth is a good example.

<p>Twitter: *You still have to burn more energy creating solar panels than solar panels can give back in a useful lifetime.*</p>
<p>Cris: *isn&rsquo;t uncritical quoting of those how â€˜fake news&rsquo; spreads?*</p>
<p>Daniel: *Right, except that I also quote Tyler Cowen who provided a lot more than a tweet.*</p>
<p>The &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; that Cris is objecting to is the potential-fact that the energy required to produce a solar panel is greater than the lifetime energy produced by that panel . Although I haven&rsquo;t researched it, I&rsquo;d be quite surprised if the claim is true. </p>
<p>Your post and response imply that Cowen confirms that energy payback is never reached, but I didn&rsquo;t see anywhere in the linked page where Cowen even discusses the energy payback period of solar panels. Perhaps it was removed? </p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s true that solar panels are a net energy sink, this seems like important knowledge to spread. If false, I&rsquo;d agree with Cris that this fits into the category of &ldquo;fake news&rdquo; even if (as Cowen points out) there are many other problems with full adoption of solar.</p>

<p>I removed the link to the unsupported tweet as it was poorly phrased. The author&rsquo;s genuine point was valid, but lost in the few characters I quoted.</p>
