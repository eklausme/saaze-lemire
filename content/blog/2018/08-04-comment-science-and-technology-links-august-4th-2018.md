<p>About whole grains and cardiovascular disease. Whole grains help with control of blood glucose as they provide fiber. So they help with diabetes and gut microbiome.</p>
<p>The comparisons they do are against refined grains diet. I&rsquo;d assume both are low on saturated fats and other significant factors in heart disease.</p>
<p>Also not all grains are the same. Oats have higher Î²-Glucans and give protection against heart disease.</p>

<p>The comment &ldquo;We are using much less land than we used to&rdquo; is a bit misleading though, as I would have intuitively assumed that this is in absolute terms and not per capita. This leads me to ask: did land use increase in absolute terms in the last 50 years?</p>

<p>The comment is immediately followed by the following sentence:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>People in 2014 used about a third of the land, compared with people from 1961, <strong>on a per capita basis</strong>.</p>

<p>US population has also INCREASED around 44% since the late 1970s&#8230;</p>
<p>per capita improvements are of little value if they are not matched by a flat or declining total population. And the social conversation seems to consist primarily of</p>
<p>â€¢ population will &ldquo;naturally&rdquo; decrease because reasons (which appear to be related, if you push, to the cost [money and opportunity] of raising children). This is why the state and society don&rsquo;t need to to worry about population growth</p>
<p>along with</p>
<p>â€¢ it is so expensive and difficult to raise children, and that is why [insert social policy] is needed to reduce this cost and difficulty.</p>
<p>The mutual incoherence in all these viewpoints seems unlikely to lead to optimal (or even positive) outcomes.</p>
