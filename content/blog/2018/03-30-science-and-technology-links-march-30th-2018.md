1. [People who score higher on intelligence tests tend to have larger brains. Twin studies suggest the same genetic factors influence both brain size and intelligence](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/03/23/287490).
1. [The effects of campaign contact and advertising on Americans&rsquo; candidates choices in general elections is zero](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3042867). A related fact: in 2016, [Clinton has outspent Trump throughout the election by more than $150 million](https://www.bustle.com/articles/158880-donald-trumps-campaign-finance-spending-is-shocking-compared-to-how-much-money-hillary-clinton-has-spent).
1. In his article &ldquo;[In defense of skepticism about deep learning](https://medium.com/@GaryMarcus/in-defense-of-skepticism-about-deep-learning-6e8bfd5ae0f1)&rdquo; (January 2018), Gary Marcus wrote &ldquo;deep learning by itself, although useful, was unlikely to lead on its own to artificial general intelligence&rdquo;.
1. &ldquo;[We want to synthesize modified versions of all the genes in the human genome in the next few years](https://www.wired.com/story/live-forever-synthetic-human-genome/)&rdquo; (George Church).
1. [Chinese students get 10% of all doctorates awarded in the U.S. There are more Chinese engineers working on AI at U.S. tech companies than in all of China.](https://www.bloomberg.com/view/articles/2018-03-23/reducing-visas-for-chinese-students-is-un-american)
1. [Women score higher in anxiety, vulnerability, altruism, and sympathy while men score higher in excitement-seeking and openness to intellect](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0191886918301521).
1. [Alcohol consumption is positively associated with handgrip strength in the elderly](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1873959818300899). Handgrip strength is strongly correlated with life expectancy.
1. [While postdocs are necessary for entry into tenure-track jobs, they do not enhance salaries in other job sectors over time](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.3766).
1. [Studies in psychology do not hold up to scrutiny](http://science.sciencemag.org/content/349/6251/aac4716):<br/>

> We conducted replications of 100 experimental and correlational studies published in three psychology journals using highÂ­-powered designs and original materials when available. Replication effects were half the magnitude of original effects, representing a substantial decline.

While 97% of the original studies had significant results only 36% of the replications had significant results. That is, given a random published study, if you bet that it is bogus, you will win most of the time.

It also seems no to matter who is doing the research:

> Moreover, correlational evidence is consistent with the conclusion that variation in the strength of initial evidence (such as original P value) was more predictive of replication success than variation in the characteristics of the teams conducting the research (such as experience and expertise).
1. [You will do better if you believe that performing cognitive work energizes you to do more](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/spc3.12381).
1. [It would have been better to invest all your money in gold back in 2000 than in the stock market](https://twitter.com/goldsilver_com/status/979478404985753600). The same is true regarding Bitcoin from its starting point. I don&rsquo;t know what it means.
1. [Almost all Economics Nobel prizes are closely related through their PhD supervisors](https://ideas.repec.org/p/sus/susewp/0518.html). This is yet more evidence that &ldquo;who you know&rdquo; is really important to your intellectual productivity.
1. [Canada celebrates its 150th birthday by creating several prestigious research chairs](http://www.insidehighered.com/news/2018/03/30/canada-announces-24-scholars-recruited-worldwide-many-top-american-universities) (via Antonio Badia). 
1. [Our ancestors had sex with the Neanderthals and the Denisovans](http://www.cell.com/cell/fulltext/S0092-8674(18)30175-2).
1. [Obesity is a recent phenomenon](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/oby.20395):<br/>

> Between the birth cohorts of 1930 and 1993, the prevalence of obesity rose from 0 to 14% among boys and from 2 to 12% among girls. (&hellip;) Among boys, all these increases began after birth year 1970. Among girls, obesity began to rise after birth year 1980 (&hellip;).


[and](http://freakonomics.com/2013/07/23/the-history-of-obesity-revisited/)

> While it may be true that body mass indexes (BMIs) have been increasing slowly for a long time, the increases observed in recent decades are much faster and have pushed many adults and children over the obesity threshold in a remarkably short time. The trend is distressing, but to reverse it we only need to turn the clock back to 1980. We don&rsquo;t need to go back to 1900.

1. [Rats did not spread the plague](http://www.pnas.org/content/early/2018/01/09/1715640115):<br/>

> While it is commonly assumed that rats and their fleas spread plague during the Second Pandemic, there is little historical and archaeological support for such a claim. Here, we show that human ectoparasites, like body lice and human fleas, might be more likely than rats to have caused the rapidly developing epidemics in pre-Industrial Europe.

1. [Alzheimer&rsquo;s disease can be spared by nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs](https://content.iospress.com/articles/journal-of-alzheimers-disease/jad170706). In other words, it could be that aspirin keeps you sharp.
