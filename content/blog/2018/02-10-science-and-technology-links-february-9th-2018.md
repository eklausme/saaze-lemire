1. [We shed 50 million skin cells every day](https://www.quora.com/Exactly-how-many-skin-cells-does-a-person-shed-daily).
1. [A mutant crayfish reproduces by cloning](https://mobile.nytimes.com/2018/02/05/science/mutant-crayfish-clones-europe.html). To my knowledge, this might be the largest animal to reproduce by cloning.<br/>

> Before about 25 years ago, the species simply did not exist (&hellip;) it has spread across much of Europe and gained a toehold on other continents. In Madagascar, where it arrived about 2007, it now numbers in the millions (&hellip;)


I note two interesting aspects to this story. The first one is that it shows that, contrary to a common belief, new species are created even today. The second one is that it brings us back to an interesting puzzle. Cloning is a lot more efficient that sex, for procreation. So why do most large animals use sex? See [The Red Queen: Sex and the Evolution of Human Nature](https://www.amazon.com/Red-Queen-Evolution-Human-Nature-ebook/dp/B006O4227U/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1518222028&#038;sr=8-1&#038;keywords=matt+ridley+sex).
1. [Some evidence that moderate (but not heavy) alcohol consumption might be good for your brain](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2213158218300408). I still would not recommend you start drinking if you aren&rsquo;t drinking right now.
1. [While the average is 106 boys born to every 100 girls, for vegetarian mothers the ratio is just 85 boys to 100 girls](http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/health/869696.stm). In other words, being a vegetarian makes it much more likely that you will give birth to girls.
1. [Researchers can simulate a worm&rsquo;s brain with a few artificial neurons](https://www.tuwien.ac.at/en/news/news_detail/article/125597/). 
1. Elon Musk&rsquo;s SpaceX company launched the most powerful rocket in the world:<br/>

> The Falcon Heavy is the world&rsquo;s 4th highest capacity rocket ever to be built (&hellip;) Falcon Heavy was designed from the outset to carry humans into space, including the Moon and Mars (&hellip;) The Falcon Heavy was developed with private capital with Musk stating that the cost was more than $500 million. No government financing was provided for its development.


[The Verge has a nice documentary on YouTube](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I7LJIuB2CHE).
1. Mitochondria are the &ldquo;power stations&rdquo; of our cells. As we age, we tend to accumulate malfunctioning mitochondria which might lead to various medical conditions. [Researchers have found that a drug targetting mitochondria could improve cognition in old mice](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.12731/abstract). 
1. Graphics processors are in high demand. Some of the best ones are made by NVIDIA. [Year-over-year, NVIDIA&rsquo;s full-year revenue increased 41% to finish at $9.71 billion in 2017](https://techgage.com/news/nvidia-crushes-its-q4-earnings-posts-41-revenue-growth-yoy/). 
1. Using lasers, [we found whole new Mayan settlements](https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2018/02/02/582664327/game-changer-maya-cities-unearthed-in-guatemala-forest-using-lasers):<br/>

> The data reveals that the area was three or four times more densely populated than originally thought. &ldquo;I mean, we&rsquo;re talking about millions of people, conservatively,&rdquo; says Garrison. &ldquo;Probably more than 10 million people.&rdquo;

1. [According to a recent research article](https://www.dovepress.com/nanomedical-studies-of-the-restoration-of-nitric-oxideperoxynitrite-ba-peer-reviewed-article-IJN), <em>vitamin D-3 has the potential to significantly reverse the damage that high blood pressure, diabetes, atherosclerosis, and other diseases inflict on the cardiovascular system</em>.
