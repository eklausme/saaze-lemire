1. [The Audi A8, which goes on sale this year, will be the first car to offer Level 3 autonomy](https://medium.economist.com/whats-it-like-to-ride-in-a-self-driving-car-24015c69cc48), which means that as a driver, you are expected to be able to relinquish control of the car to the computer in most instances.
1. [Standard tests do predict how well you will do in college](https://www.wsj.com/amp/articles/the-truth-about-the-sat-and-act-1520521861) with reasonable accuracy.
1. On the topic of psychology being in trouble as a field&hellip; introductory psychology textbooks [are misrepresenting the science of intelligence](https://digest.bps.org.uk/2018/03/08/best-selling-introductory-psychology-books-give-a-misleading-view-of-intelligence/):<br/>

> (&hellip;) over 93 per cent of the books covered Gardner&rsquo;s multiple intelligences and over 89 per cent covered Sternberg&rsquo;s triarchic theory of intelligence, even though neither of these theories are mainstream or well-supported by evidence (&hellip;) In contrast, fewer than a quarter of the books covered the most strongly supported contemporary, hierarchical theories (&hellip;) Other common inaccuracies included promotion of the idea that it is not possible to measure intelligence in a meaningful way (&hellip;), and claims that intelligence is only relevant in academic settings (&hellip;). Among the logical fallacies in the books is what&rsquo;s known as Lewontin&rsquo;s fallacy â€œ this idea, advanced in six of the books, states that because humans share about 99 per cent of the same genes, that genes cannot therefore have a role in the differences between individuals or groups. (&hellip;) Twelve other fallacies appeared in the books such as (&hellip;) claiming that intelligence doesn&rsquo;t exist because it is a collection of abilities (&hellip;), Warne highlights issues around the discussion of the taboo topic of race and IQ; textbook authors overplaying the role of stereotype threat, and authors having a tendency to overestimate environmental influences on intelligence (&hellip;)

1. According to several news reports: [Luck plays a significant role in how succesful you are](https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/beautiful-minds/the-role-of-luck-in-life-success-is-far-greater-than-we-realized/). [The article that generated this discussion](https://arxiv.org/abs/1802.07068) proves nothing of the sort. More critically, it is unclear whether believing that success comes through luck is a good belief to hold. I prefer to assume that I am responsible for the outcomes, both positives and negatives.
1. Nature reports on [nanorobots that can deliver cancer medicine in a targetted manner](https://www.nature.com/articles/nbt.4071).
1. According to the famous Harvard economist Rogoff, [a bitcoin might be worth only $100 in ten years](https://www.marketwatch.com/story/forget-100000-bitcoin-says-kenneth-rogoff-try-100-instead-2018-03-06). I dicussed Rogoff&rsquo;s work earlier regarding [the Reinhart-Rogoff case](/lemire/blog/2013/04/23/share-your-software-early-the-reinhart-rogoff-case/).
1. According to an article in Nature, [genetics explains only a small part of differences in how long a person lives](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-018-02596-9).
1. [Visible light affects how long worms live](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-02934-5), still in Nature. It means you must control for lightning when trying to reproduce experiments on worms.
1. [Inviting men with no symptoms to a one-off test for prostate cancer does not save lives according to results from the largest ever prostate cancer trial conducted over 10 years.](http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/about-us/cancer-news/press-release/2018-03-06-one-off-psa-screening-for-prostate-cancer-does-not-save-lives) That more medical testing does not save more lives is unintuitive, but it is well known in epidemiology.
