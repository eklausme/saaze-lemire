title: "Income, wealth, intelligence and the fall of the American empire"
---



[Arcand](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denys_Arcand)&lsquo;s latest movie ([the Fall of the American Empire](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Fall_of_the_American_Empire)) depicts a young man (Pierre-Paul Daoust) who is supposedly very intelligent, but not very wealthy. The movie begins with the character explaining that intelligence actually gets in the way of success.

I have certainly met my share of folks who must have very high intelligence and who are not particularly wealthy. There are many interesting intellectuals like [Grigori Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman) who are obviously three standard deviations above the average in intelligence, but not in wealth.

What does the research says about this? Psychologists measure intelligence using IQ tests.

[There is much evidence that people with a higher IQ have a higher income](https://search.proquest.com/openview/0f4a9f33e3c856af755f4cab647f54d6/). The correlation is relatively high (between 0.3 and 0.4). And [the elite are largely drawn from the intellectually gifted](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Jonathan_Wai/publication/236611824_Investigating_America%27s_Elite_Cognitive_Ability_Education_and_Sex_Differences/links/5ad78125458515c60f5883a5/Investigating-Americas-Elite-Cognitive-Ability-Education-and-Sex-Differences.pdf).

But wait! Income is not the same thing as wealth&hellip; [the impact of IQ scores on net worth after accounting for other factors is either zero or close to zero](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0160289607000219), according to economist Jay Zagorsky. Sadly, this is a single study from 2007 and I could not find any relevant follow-up work to validate the analysis.

All and all, I can find no evidence that a high intelligence is an obstacle in the quest for success.
