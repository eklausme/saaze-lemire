1. When you are trying to determine whether a drug is effective, it is tempting to look at published papers and see whether they all agree on the efficacity of the drug. This may be quite wrong: [Turner et al. show a strong bias whereas negative results are never published](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMsa065779).<br/>

> Studies viewed by the FDA as having negative or questionable results were, with 3 exceptions, either not published (22 studies) or published in a way that, in our opinion, conveyed a positive outcome (11 studies). According to the published literature, it appeared that 94% of the trials conducted were positive. By contrast, the FDA analysis showed that 51% were positive. Separate meta-analyses of the FDA and journal data sets showed that the increase in effect size ranged from 11 to 69% for individual drugs and was 32% overall.



Simply put, it is far easier and profitable to publish positive results so that&rsquo;s what you get.

This means that, by default, you should always downgrade the optimism of the litterature.

Simply put: don&rsquo;t be too quick to believe what you read, even if it is comes in the form of a large set of peer-reviewed research papers.
