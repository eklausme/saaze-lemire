<p>Thank you, very nice summary!</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how fast the brain will accept virtual limbs as its own, if the latency is low enough. There have been psychological lab experiments about this, but now everyone can experience it first hand.</p>
<p>I hope game developers read your blog. You are pointing to very interesting avenues.</p>

<p>Actually what you say is quite fascinating. The only two games to excel are quite &#8211; as you say &#8211; different. This is good. It is also good that it doesn&rsquo;t take fantastic graphics/immersive realism to make games absorbing.</p>
<p>That means there is a whole new kind(s) of game waiting to be invented, and these games could take off in any direction. For me this is exciting since I have found little in the game world to be excited about for a very long time.</p>

<p>It is clear that VR gaming is in it&rsquo;s infancy, and will be growing very quickly in the years ahead.<br/>
I agree with Dominic, I think the vast variety of games types that work well in VR is it&rsquo;s strength.</p>
<p>For example:<br/>
Realistic simulation games: Eleven Table Tennis<br/>
Cartoony cart racing: Blazerush<br/>
Scary games: Resident Evil 7 and Arizona Sunshine.</p>
<p>It is clear, that once face and eye tracking come out (as rumored to be in the next version of the FB Oculus Rift), multiplayer first person games and experiences will become vastly more compelling than 2D games.</p>

<p>You should give car racing games a shot in VR. I find that it is very engaging (On the PS4 the VR mode of Gran Turismo Sport and on the PC Project Cars 2 and Assetto Corsa), With a Wheel and pedals all that is lacking is the inner ear and gut moving sensations.</p>
