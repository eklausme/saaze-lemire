<p>It looks like your underlying assumption is that a PHD is only good for doing basic research or teaching.<br/>
If so, yes, there are too many.</p>

<p>PhDs are people who spent 4, 5, 6, 7 or even 9 years training to do research. Not programming, not engineering&#8230; research.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s interesting. As a long-time non-degreed self-educated software engineer, I always imagined having a PhD gave someone the advantage of having studied theory at a high level, which might be of real value in a practical engineering world. I have always respected the doctorate-holders I&rsquo;ve worked with for their wider understanding of systems, underlying principles, and so on &#8211; it&rsquo;s like they&rsquo;ve been up to the mountain top and seen the Big View, while I&rsquo;ve been clambering around in the underbrush learning what I can from the things right around me. In a certain sense, every software engineering shop is engaged in a kind of research, so having been involved in formal academic research isn&rsquo;t a bad experience to have had. But that&rsquo;s only me limited view!</p>

<p>You can measure these things.</p>
<p>What is the pay difference between someone who got a simple degree and someone who has a PhD?</p>
<p>What I have read is that on an age-corrected basis (so comparing people who have the same age), PhD holders do not earn more. They may even earn less because they have less work experience.</p>
<p>That is, who earns more&#8230; a 30-year-old engineer with 7 years of experience in industry&#8230; or a 30-year-old with no industry experience whatsoever but a freshly minted PhD?</p>
<p>To this you must add that during their PhD, the PhD holders earned substantially less.</p>
<p>Of course, there are benefits to having a PhD. But I submit to you that it is easy to overestimate the benefits outside academic jobs.</p>
