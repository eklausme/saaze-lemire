<blockquote><p>
Excess of inflammation is the key ingredient in many nasty diseases
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think inflammation may be a response to, rather than a cause of damage. If this is the case than suppressing inflammation would likely do little to help the situation.</p>
<p>And if inflammation is the body&rsquo;s response to repair damage suppressing it may actually be harmful.</p>
<p>According to Dr Malcolm Kendrick, anti-inflammatory medicines like corticosteroids and NSAIDs actually increase the risk of heart attacks.<br/>

<p>Contrary to what Kendrick suggests, there is overwhelming evidence that your immune system can malfunction and cause harm.</p>
<p>Whether it has anything to do with cardiovascular health&#8230; I have no idea. I honestly don&rsquo;t have a clue as to what causes heart attacks and strokes.</p>

<blockquote><p>

</p></blockquote>
<p>No doubt, but Kendrick does mention this in his article:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Medically they are used in a number of auto-immune/inflammatory<br/>
conditions, ranging from rheumatoid arthritis, ulcerative colitis,<br/>
eczema, lupus, transplant organ rejection and suchlike [Asthma is a<br/>
bit different].</p>
<p> In these conditions, there is a rationale for reducing inflammation.<br/>
Here, we have the body â€˜seeing&rsquo; various proteins as alien, and<br/>
attacking them, through an â€˜auto-immune&rsquo; response. Yes, there is<br/>
inflammation. However, this is not the body trying to repair itself.<br/>
This is the immune system causing damage, by attacking the body<br/>
itself, with resulting inflammation. In short, do not confuse<br/>
inflammation with inflammation.
</p></blockquote>
<p>I think inflammation is perhaps like fire trucks trying to put out fires. You&rsquo;ll firetrucks wherever there are fires, but that doesn&rsquo;t mean they are the cause of the fires. I could be wrong of course, but that is my impression.</p>

<p>Excess firetruck would be the scenario where firetrucks get out of control and start spraying a whole neighbourhood because they are convinced that this the only way to save the neighbourhood. It does not mean that there wasn&rsquo;t an initial fire to put out&#8230; but maybe it was just a small kitchen fire that required not firetruck at all.</p>

<p>for the 3rd link, i think i should add some comments as a chinese.</p>
<p>of course many and many chinese move to cities in the past serveral decades, and it used to be single direction, but now there&rsquo;re small groups of chinese move for the opposite direction including me. and as i knew, many of them has technology background like me.</p>
