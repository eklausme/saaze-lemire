<p>Well, this is a provocative question for Paul Stamets.</p>

<p>To be clear, it seems I have existed with a fungus infection most of my life. When I was 14 years old, I caught a cold that turned into something much worse. I only recovered when the doctor finally prescribed strong antibiotics.</p>
<p>This same pattern repeated about every four years. I caught a routine respiratory bug. It got much, much worse. Once given strong antibiotics, I recovered.</p>
<p>Decades back I asked my then-doctor why this pattern kept repeating. He could not be bothered. Nor could the next.</p>
<p>Several years back, went to my new doctor very sick. I had lost a lot of weight (not of purpose). He prescribed strong antibiotics, and I recovered. I asked about the past pattern, and he started doing tests.</p>
<p>I got very, very lucky. He saw something subtle slightly amiss in the results. That lead to more tests. And then visits to a specialist. The specialist ultimately had to take a sample of the tissue in my lungs. (Not a fun procedure, I can report.) The sample was sent off to a lab, with results expected in a few weeks. A few days later, the lab called back. I most definitely had fungus in my lungs.</p>
<p>That lead to yet another specialist, who prescribed strong doses of Fluconazole. The side effects are quite nasty. The &ldquo;cure&rdquo; rate is very uncertain. I eventually stopped taken the medication. Take this as an informed judgement.</p>
<p>Thing is, I ran past the edge of existing science.</p>
<p>The guidance for this sort of fungus (when called &ldquo;valley fever&rdquo;) is that it resolves in a year. My doctors were all properly careful to only refer to the infection as recent. A few years after, my primary doctor repeated tests to verify the fungus is still present.</p>
<p>There is no guidance for doctors in this case.</p>
<p>Though there is no present known effective cure, knowing the cause is an enormous relief.</p>
<p>But &#8230; yes. Fungus can make us sick.</p>
