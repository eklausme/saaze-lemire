1. [Single cells are able to navigate complex mazes](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/369/6507/eaay9792.full). E.g., it works with mouse pancreatic cancer cells.
1. Body builders and athletes sometimes take a supplement called AKG. It was found to prolong life in worms. [Researchers have now found that AKG massively delays frailty in mice](https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/a-metabolite-produced-by-the-body-increases-lifespan-and-dramatically-compresses-late-life-morbidity-in-mice/): old mice that took AKG look better and are stronger. The mice also live a bit longer.
1. [Hair dyes applied at home are not associated with greater cancer risks](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmj.m2942).
1. Plaque in the arteries is correlated with cardiovascular diseases (heart attacks) and tends to accumulate with age. [Researchers have determined that a daily supplement of something called IPE could reverse the amount of plaque in a relatively small clinical trial](https://academic.oup.com/eurheartj/advance-article/doi/10.1093/eurheartj/ehaa652/5898836).
1. [A company called NuScale got a new nuclear reactor design approved](https://arstechnica.com/science/2020/09/first-modular-nuclear-reactor-design-certified-in-the-us/) in the US. It took over two million pages of documentation. These are new, small and very safe reactors. They should become commercially available in a few years.
1. People who suffer from diabetes are at greater risk of death from diseases like COVID 19. [Researchers found that those taking metformin (a cheap and popular anti-diabetes drug) are protected from COVID 19](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.07.29.20164020v1).
1. [In mice, both caloric restriction (eating less) and a drug called rapamycin, prolongs female fertility into old age](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31359237/).
