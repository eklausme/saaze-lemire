<p>Many traditional engineering innovations are based on empirically derived data, including the lift data that started with <a href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Otto_Lilienthal" rel="nofollow ugc">Otto Lilienthal:</a></p>
<blockquote><p>Lilienthal&rsquo;s research was well known to the Wright brothers, and they credited him as a major inspiration for their decision to pursue manned flight. However, they abandoned his aeronautical data after two seasons of gliding and began using their own wind tunnel data.</p></blockquote>
<p>The Wright Flyer was perhaps the greatest example of simultaneous engineering innovation required to solve a single problem: heavier than air flight. Perhaps as a society we underestimate the applied sciences and underemphasize the importance of empirical breakthroughs. The Wright Brothers&rsquo; wind tunnel data was &ldquo;good enough&rdquo; in the classic refrain of engineers everywhere. It is a fantastic story and it is mostly mistold.</p>
