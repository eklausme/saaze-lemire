Someone reminded me of a prediction I made in 2011:
<blockquote class="twitter-tweet">
<p dir="ltr" lang="en">Your iPhone will have 1TB of storage by 2020, assuming exponential growth, see my plot: [http://t.co/iDiT1J7y](http://t.co/iDiT1J7y)

At the time, an iPhone could hold at most 32 GB of data, so 1 TB sounded insane.

Unfortunately, Google Plus is no more so you cannot see the plot showing my projection and I lost it as well. Yet we can build a table:

2010                     |iPhone 4                 |32 GB                    |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
2012                     |iPhone 5                 |64 GB                    |
2014                     |iPhone 6                 |128 GB                   |
2016                     |iPhone 7                 |256 GB                   |
2018                     |iPhone XS                |512 GB                   |
2019                     |iPhone 11 Pro            |512 GB                   |
2020                     |iPhone 12 Pro            |512 GB                   |


How did my prediction fare ? I got it wrong, of course, but I think it was remarkably prescient. It seems obvious that Apple could have gone with 1 TB but chose not to. [The Samsun Galaxy S10+ comes with 1 TB of storage](https://www.samsung.com/us/mobile/galaxy-s10/).

[Some analysts predict that the iPhone 13 might have 1 TB of storage](https://www.tomsguide.com/news/iphone-13-will-reportedly-boast-up-to-1tb-of-storage).
