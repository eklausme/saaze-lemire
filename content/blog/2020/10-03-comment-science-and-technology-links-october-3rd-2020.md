<p>Aha (RE: Alzheimers). My 1000 years diet wins again (my notion is that if your genetic group hasn&rsquo;t been eating it for a thousand years, then don&rsquo;t eat it in regularly or in quantity). The thousand years is somewhat arbitrary, a proxy for how long it may take for our species to fully and safely adapt to a particular food. Maybe is is as little as 200 &#8211; but whatever.</p>
<p>That includes corn syrup, fructose or galactose, margarine and any of the other 20th century processed foods brought to us by religious extremists (kellogs et al).</p>
