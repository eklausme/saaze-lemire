1. Researchers find that [older people can lose weight just as easily as younger people](https://warwick.ac.uk/newsandevents/pressreleases/age_is_no/).
1. Google DeepMind claims to have solved [the protein folding problem](https://deepmind.com/blog/article/alphafold-a-solution-to-a-50-year-old-grand-challenge-in-biology), an important problem in medicine. This breakthrough could greatly accelerate drug development and lead to new cures. Yet,[not everyone is convinced that they actually solved the problem](http://occamstypewriter.org/scurry/2020/12/02/no-deepmind-has-not-solved-protein-folding/).
1. &ldquo;Indian Americans have risen to become the richest ethnicity in America, with an average household income of $126,891 (compared to the US average of $65,316). (&hellip;) Almost 40% of all Indians in the United States have a masterâ€™s, doctorate, or other professional degree, which is five times the national average.&rdquo; ([source](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Indian_Americans))
1. There is a popular idea in the US currently: we should just forgive all student debts. [Catherine and Yannelis find that](https://bfi.uchicago.edu/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/BFI_WP_2020169.pdf) &ldquo;universal and capped forgiveness policies are highly regressive, with the vast majority of benefits accruing to high-income individuals.&rdquo;
1. [Researchers successfully deployed advanced genetic engineering techniques (based on CRISPR) against cancer in mice](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/6/47/eabc9450.full).
1. [Researchers rejuvenated the cells in the eyes old mice, restauring their vision](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2975-4). (Source: Nature.)
1. Remember all these studies claiming that birth order determined your fate, with older siblings going more in science and younger siblings going for more artistic careers? [It seems that these results do not replicate very well given a re-analysis.](https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/0890207020969010) The effects are much weaker than initially believed and they do not necessarily go in the expected direction.
1. Older people (over 70) have less zinc in their blood. [Their zinc level predicts their mortality rate](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10522-009-9251-1). The more zinc, the less likely they are to die.
1. [Shenzhen (China) has truly driveless cars on the roads](https://techcrunch.com/2020/12/02/autox-removes-safety-drivers/).
1. [Centanarians have low levels of blood sugar, and they are less likely to suffer from diabetes than adults in general](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/32643047/).
1. [We have an actual treatment to help people suffering from progeria](https://www.fda.gov/news-events/press-announcements/fda-approves-first-treatment-hutchinson-gilford-progeria-syndrome-and-some-progeroid-laminopathies), a crippling disease.
1. [Eating eggs is quite safe](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31965140/).
1. The state-of-the-art in image processing includes convolutional neural networks (CNN). Though it gives good results, it is a computationally expensive approach. [Google has adapted a technique from natural-language processing called transformers to the task and they report massive gains in computational efficiency](http://ai.googleblog.com/2020/12/transformers-for-image-recognition-at.html).
