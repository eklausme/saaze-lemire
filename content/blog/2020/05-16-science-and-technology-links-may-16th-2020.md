1. Most of our processors, whether in our PCs or mobile phones, are 64-bit processors. In the case of your PC, it has been so for a couple of decades. Unfortunately, we have been stuck with 32-bit operating systems for a long time. [Apple has stopped supporting 32-bit applications in the most recent version of its macOS operating system](https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT208436) and 32-bit applications have stopped running on the iPhone quite some time ago. [Microsoft will now stop providing 32-bit versions of its operating system](https://tech.slashdot.org/story/20/05/14/148254/microsoft-takes-step-toward-phasing-out-32-bit-pc-support-for-windows-10).

1. [If you transplant fecal microbes from old to young rats, you age the young rats](https://www.aging-us.com/article/103093/text). We have solid evidence that blood transfusions from old mammals to young mammals will age the young recipient ([Nature, 2016](https://www.nature.com/articles/ncomms13363)). The other direction, evidently more useful, is achievable in vitro, but harder to achieve in actual organisms. In what might be a breakthrough, [Horvath et al. report](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.05.07.082917v1) system-wide rejuventation in rats using plasma (blood) transfusion: <em>the treatment more than halved the epigenetic ages of blood, heart, and liver tissue</em>. Details are missing and we should reserve judgement. Horvath is a well regarded scientist from UCLA.
