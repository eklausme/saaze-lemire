<p>Yes, speaking racism, you can find out what works and what doesn&rsquo;t by looking at what companies that have been found at variance with community standards are willing to do about it.</p>
<p>Companies are most likely to do what will cause the least change to what they are already doing. Anti-bias training is probably the single most popular thing and I would argue that that is <em>because</em> it doesn&rsquo;t work. What companies (and right wing pundits) argue most strenuously against is the idea of &ldquo;quotas&rdquo; &#8211; and my bet is that is because they would work if adopted.</p>

<p>I agree with your comment. I think it is convenient and, in the greater scheme of things, inexpensive.</p>

<p>This is such a hard discussion to have on the internet without being interpreted poorly or causing heat. I have no intention of either of these. I write this sincerely. I think this blog might have a rather logical and professional audience, so I hope someone can help me understand his or her reasoning.</p>
<p>What is the problem that is meant to be solved? As far as I can tell, to assume that the training could &ldquo;work&rdquo; in the same way that quotas would &ldquo;work&rdquo; is to presume that employees involved in the hiring processes are bigoted based on certain shallow, protected characteristics. Is this not the presumption of guilt?</p>
<p>If quotas are what the definition implies, would they not be responding to the possibility of bigotry or discrimination with 100% definite discrimination of the same kind? Why isn&rsquo;t this the case? If the goal isn&rsquo;t to remove discrimination, but is instead something like &ldquo;representation,&rdquo; shallow &ldquo;diversity,&rdquo; or &ldquo;illogical and bigoted (in my opinion) customer acquisition,&rdquo; I still have the same question.</p>
<p>I just really don&rsquo;t understand why people seem willing to discriminate against innocent members of protected classes or why they seem to think they are doing the opposite. It doesn&rsquo;t seem right to me.</p>
<p>Thanks for your patience, and thanks if anyone can help me understand the logic behind these proposed solutions.</p>
