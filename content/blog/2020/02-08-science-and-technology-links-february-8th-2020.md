1. It is often believed that radiations are bad for you. To the contrary, David et al. report that [life expectancy is approximately 2.5 years longer in people living in areas with an elevated background radiation](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/832949v1) in the USA. 
1. Birth order, that is whether you are the oldest or youngest sibling, is independently associated with a number of health and performance metrics. The first born is usually more fit and stable. [Lin et al. argue that the main explanation might be that younger siblings are more likely to have been unwanted](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00148-019-00747-4).
1. [The University of California has completely cancelled its subscription to research papers by Elsevier](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-00758-x). Elsevier is one of the most important scientific publisher. It is also a for-profit publisher.
1. Low levels of Low-density lipoprotein cholesterol (LDL-C), often qualified as &ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo;, [are strongly and independently associated with increased risk of cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and all-cause mortality according to a Korean study made of hundreds of thousands of human subjects](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31581520-low-levels-of-low-density-lipoprotein-cholesterol-and-mortality-outcomes-in-non-statin-users/). This new study puts into question mainstream beliefs about &ldquo;bad cholesterol&rdquo;.
1. Education is strongly associated with better health and better longevity. However, after controlling for income and living conditions, [the relationship between health and education evaporates](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0277953620300496). 
1. Harvard&rsquo;s George Church has created a startup that will use [an anti-aging gene therapy to increase the longevity of dogs](https://cen.acs.org/pharmaceuticals/gene-therapy/anti-aginggene-therapy-trial-dogs/97/web/2019/11). It is based on previous work done on mice and reported in a paper entitled [A single combination gene therapy treats multiple age-related diseases](https://www.pnas.org/content/early/2019/10/31/1910073116) (source: PNAS).
1. As we age, 90% of us will get gray hair. It is often believed to be an irreversible process. [Researchers at the University of Alabama found strong evidence that it is not the case and they believe that hair graying can be reversed](https://www.uab.edu/reporter/research/discoveries-innovations/item/8990-going-gray-isn-t-a-one-way-trip-uab-researcher-exploring-ways-to-rejuvenate-gray-hairs/). They are launching a company to develop the therapy. Note that there is documented but anecdotal evidence for gray-hair reversal, e.g., in cancer patients.
