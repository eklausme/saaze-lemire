1. [The benefits of flu vaccines in healthy adults is modest](https://www.cochrane.org/CD001269/ARI_vaccines-prevent-influenza-healthy-adults). They do not reduce neonatal death, hospitalisations, or working day lost. [It does not seem more helpful in older adults](https://annals.org/aim/article-abstract/2762506/effect-influenza-vaccination-elderly-hospitalization-mortality-observational-study-regression-discontinuity).
1. [While in 1970, only 1% of the American population was severely obese, the percentage of obesity is now at 9%](https://apnews.com/a2154b643d53afae2a3654f722a9b60a).
1. [Older adults who volunteer and stay active maintain a larger brain](http://bachlab.pitt.edu/sites/default/files/Carlson2015.pdf).
1. [The election of Donald Trump in 2016 lead to slightly fewer baby boys in Canada](https://dx.doi.org/10.1136/bmjopen-2019-031208). Stress tends to favor female births.
1. [The plague is still killing people in Madagascar](https://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/25/2/17-1974_article). The disease is carried by rats.
1. The social cost of carbon has been estimated to be as high as $60 a tonne, meaning that if we spent $60 to remove the production of a tonne of carbon, we would be even. [Some of the latest recent estimates are much lower: between $0.60 and $3](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10018-020-00263-w). These new estimates take into account the benefits of CO2 such as higher plant productivity.
