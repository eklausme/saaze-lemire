<p>If there is doubt on results published somewhere, you should at least note the doubts in pubpeer.com for example. So that others can see there was doubt if they can&rsquo;t reproduce the results.<br/>
We&rsquo;re now seeing post-publication peer review to become more and more important, and this seems to be the right place to use them.</p>

<p>RE 2. the earth is getting greener</p>
<blockquote><p>Modelling indicates that greening could mitigate global warming by <b>increasing the carbon sink on land</b> and altering biogeophysical processes, mainly evaporative cooling.</p></blockquote>
<p>As much as I like and agree with this paper&rsquo;s non-alarmist stance, I think any model that indicates an increased carbon sink without a new mechanism to precipitate carbon out of the system is flawed. Carbon emissions are outpacing the carbon cycle&rsquo;s capacity to adapt. That fact is captured in atmospheric concentration measures. The answer to flawed models is not equally flawed models.</p>

<p>RE 4. Robot Blood Samples<br/>
The <a href="https://www.worldscientific.com/doi/abs/10.1142/S2339547819500067" rel="nofollow ugc"> original paper</a> says:</p>
<blockquote><p>The device demonstrated results comparable to or exceeding that of clinical standards, with a success rate of 87% on all participants (n = 31), a 97% success rate on nondifficult venous access participants (n = 25), and an average procedure time of 93 Â± 30 s (n = 31). In the future, this device can be extended to other areas of vascular access such as IV catheterization, central venous access, dialysis, and arterial line placement.</p></blockquote>
<p>That is cool and especially interesting when compared to the Theranos 1.0 device (failed microfluidics) and 2.0 device (failed robotic automation). This device is the front-end to a Theranos 2.0 style system and removes the need for the specialized walk-in clinic partners that Theranos depended on. As a side note, it is a shame that the Theranos debacle has distracted us from the key lesson from the failure of the 1.0 microfluidic device: independent microfluidic test interact in unexpected ways when combined in close proximity to one another. Lab-on-a-Single-Strip is still achievable I think.</p>

<p>RE 5. Heated Disk Drives</p>
<p>I wonder why the energy requirements are not mentioned; it seems like a key constraint along with thermal characteristics.</p>

<p>Since universities do not care about experiment data, and publishers care a lot and really do not want the data to be included with articles, what really did anybody expect?</p>
<p>Do people really expect researchers to keep the data forever by themselves, with no help and nobody even caring about it?</p>

<p>Some journals ask for the data and the software. I have published some papers where someone actually looked at my data and my software and vouched for reproducibility.</p>
<p>I cannot speak for all fields, but there are certainly communities in computer science where making your data available is viewed positively.</p>
<p>Overall, you are correct that the incentives are not aligned to favour data conservation.</p>
