title: "A journal that gets it"
---



There is a special issue of [JIME](http://www-jime.open.ac.uk/) on Semantic Web for Education (as in &ldquo;Learning Objects&rdquo;). I picked it up from [Downes](http://www.downes.ca)&lsquo; in one recent post.

Not only is the issue interesting, from what I could tell, it is a journal that gets it. First of all, reviews are on-line, for all to see. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: I don&rsquo;t mind peer review. I cherish it. But I&rsquo;ve gotten too many poorly written, poorly prepared reviews. I really wish reviews would go on-line when the paper is published. This way, it might give an incentive to the reviewer.

Plus, if a poor paper gets accepted, you can trace back the reasons why it was accepted&hellip;

It still doesn&rsquo;t help if your paper gets rejected for bad reasons, but in such instances, you can go elsewhere with your paper. At the very least, you know that if the paper makes it, you&rsquo;ll have an exciting review to go with it. Useful for you and the reader.

Update: other blogs have picked up this issue of JIME.
