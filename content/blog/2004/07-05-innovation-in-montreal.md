title: "Innovation in Montreal"

Still looking for creative folks in Montreal. I figured that I&rsquo;d follow the money. Found Innovatech&rsquo;s web site. It is particularly nice because they list the companies they&rsquo;ve invested in. I think it is a Quebec government shop, probably along the lines of IRAP, but with maybe much less of a research strength. Also interesting, maybe, is T2C2 capital which seems to fund IT startups for those crazy folks willing to launch a startup.

Of course, money is not the key ingredient. Remember rule number 2 from previous post: keep in lean.
