title: "Transparent aliminium: at last"
---



Last night, I got my wife to watch Star Trek IV again with me. I got all excited when I found out that [3M researchers had invented what seems to me to be transparent aliminium](http://physicsweb.org/article/news/8/8/9). Of course, as <i>everyone</i> knows, transparent aluminium was passed on to us by Scotty, the famous spaceship engineer, when the crew of the Enterprise travelled back in time to save whales.
