title: "Most amazing Cringely article ever&#8230;"

Cringely published an amazing paper on crime in the USA. Turns out that in 1982, a study was paid-for by the American Department of Justice. Three people were involved: [Michael Block](http://www.goldwaterinstitute.org/experts.php/43.html), Fred Nold, and Sandy Lerner. Cringely believes their study showed that the current sentencing guidelines would lead to a poor, more crime-ridden USA (and it did). The study was &ldquo;hidden away&rdquo;. Turns out that killed himself in 1983. Block became a law professor and won&rsquo;t comment to Cringely about the study. Sandy Lerner went on to found [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/).

A few things are amazing. The suicide of a researcher who possibly felt like a loser. It reminds me of Wallace Carothers who invented Nylon. It is unclear to me how you can feel like a loser after inventing Nylon, but apparently someone did. The second one is that the USA knows and knew that they were headed for a crime-ridden society and they went ahead anyhow. Why? I can&rsquo;t figure it out. Lastly, there is the little detail that the statistician part of the study, Sandy Lerner, founded [Cisco](http://www.cisco.com/). This is an interesting contrast with the other fellow who killed himself.
