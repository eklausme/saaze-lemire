Sean was cool enough to invite me to join Gmail. Gmail is the Google free email service where you have almost unlimited storage (1GB to be precise) and various cool Google tools to search your emails.

I&rsquo;m not convinced I&rsquo;ll use it very much, but it is cool to have it. My address is lemire atsymbol gmail dotted com.

Thanks Sean!

Update: Several weeks later, I&rsquo;ve switched over completly and I&rsquo;m now using Gmail exclusively.
