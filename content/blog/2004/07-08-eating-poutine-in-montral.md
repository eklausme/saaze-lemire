title: "Eating poutine in Montr√©al"
---



Through Seb, I found [Idle Words](http://www.idlewords.com/). The guy is moving to Montreal and just discovered Poutine. If you know what poutine is, you&rsquo;ve got to go read [his post on his first Poutine experience](http://www.idlewords.com/2004/07/canada_day.htm): hilarious.

Actually, last time I ate poutine was one I made myself. Well, at least, I made the French fries myself. It was pretty good, but it is a bad meal if you plan to do any work in the 2-3 days after eating it and you are past thirty.

Here&rsquo;s my recipe for French fries. Buy lots of olive oil. Cut some Yukon gold potatoes (the yellow type) and let the cut potatoes in water a few minutes, then dry them. Heat up the oil over the stove, make sure the oil is very hot, but also make sure you don&rsquo;t overheat (if there is smoke, it became to hot). Then, using only a small amount of potatoes each time, drop them the potatoes in the oil. Be careful not to burn yourself! You must make sure you don&rsquo;t put all of the potatoes at once, otherwise you will drop the temperature of the oil too low and you&rsquo;ll produce greasy French fries. That&rsquo;s essentially it.

You can use these hand-made French fries to seduce a girl (or a guy, I suppose).
