Through Didier, I got to [Victor Shoup&rsquo;s Home Page](http://www.shoup.net/). He has an on-line textbook called [A Computational Introduction to Number Theory and Algebra](http://www.shoup.net/ntb/). It is unclear whether he intends the textbook to remain free, but it is pretty cool to post the book on his home page. Shoup&rsquo;s is an expert in cryptography.
