<p>My thesis is full of highlighted dates like 1702? or 3? I even wasted a whole page the oother day because mybecause I thought two pieces of evidence were in the same year and they weren&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>I take it, Claire, that memorizing dates is not your forte, right? Yet, by all accounts, you must be good in history.</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s why I went into computer science. How did you handle closed-book, closed-notes tests? How do you avoid memorizing theorems and formulas for these?</p>

<p>> How do you avoid memorizing theorems and formulas for these? </p>
<p>Where I studied mathematics the most, at UofT, you didn&rsquo;t have much in terms of &ldquo;state the XYZ theorem&rdquo;. I can&rsquo;t remember much, yes I&rsquo;m that old, but I&rsquo;m pretty sure most questions on exams were the problem-solving type. Beside, knowing the theorems well was a non-issue if you did the (very hard) homeworks: there is no way you didn&rsquo;t internalized most of the important theorems if you sweated for hours over how you are supposed to use them to solve a given problem. Over time, you came to understand that knowing the statement of theorem was actually knowing very little. You had to really gain an intuition for the theorem&#8230; and once you have the intuition, the rest is easy.</p>
<p>In fact, a training in math., CS, Physics or Chemistry should be pretty much identical. Assuming you attend a good school. A school that has you memorize theorems and formulas to pass courses is a bad one.</p>

<p>I agree that there is little value in student memorizing facts and theorems without learning how to apply them. I also got through my physics undergrad largely on intuition. I was too lazy to work out hundreds of problems, so I focused on the basic principles and relied on my understanding and intuition to solve whatever problems came up. I did OK, but I wouldn&rsquo;t advise this as a study technique to anyone. Had I done the hundreds of problems, I would have done much better and would be eligible for SSHRC grants! </p>
<p>Even relying on intuition, however, I need to know something. I needed to know the basic formulas. You do need to be able to remember things to be able to apply them. To give a simplistic example, memorizing your phone number without knowing how to use a phone is fairly useless. However, knowing how to use a phone without knowing any phone numbers is equally useless!</p>
<p>I promise I won&rsquo;t let my students get away with rote memorization. They will need to remember things, but they will need to know how to apply their knowledge.</p>
