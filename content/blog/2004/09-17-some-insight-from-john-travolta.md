title: "Some insight from John Travolta"
---



This morning, I was chatting with a colleague, Richard Hotte, and we were discussing research, funding, and the relation between the two. I&rsquo;ve also had these discussions with Martin Brooks. Richard pointed out that John Travolta has figured it out all some years ago when he received a prize at Cannes for the movie Pulp Fiction. According to Richard, Travolta was asked then about how it felt to finally win a prize that he surely coveted for many years. John Travolta answered that his goal was never to win a prize, but rather to grow as an actor. The prize was nice, but not his goal.

This echoes my own feeling about funding for research. If your goal is funding, you&rsquo;ll probably get some, maybe a lot, but unfortunately, you may never become a great researcher.
