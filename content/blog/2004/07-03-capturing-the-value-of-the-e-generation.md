title: "Capturing the Value of the e-Generation"

Here&rsquo;s an interesting article, Capturing the Value of &ldquo;Generation Tech&rdquo; Employees, I got through Downes&rsquo;.

The premise of the article is that there is a new generation (&lt; 30 years old) which was born with computers around and thus, thinks and act differently. I&rsquo;d argue that even if I&rsquo;m thirty something, I still belong to the tech generation, or rather, the tech natives, whatever it means since I got my first computer as I kid and learned to program assembly and BASIC when I was 13 years old. Other than that, the article seems fairly accurate. It matches my expectations.

- The tech natives are team-based, not hierarchy-based. This is sooo amazingly true. I see many older people who want to stick with a heavy hierarchy, but it just doesn&rsquo;t fit the new business model in a tech era. When things are fast changing, it doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have 10 superiors on top of you. It also doesn&rsquo;t make sense to have 10 layers of people under you. You need to get at your team directly, and you need to get the feedback from your boss right away. Layers don&rsquo;t make so much sense anymore.
- The tech natives crave information, they don&rsquo;t fear it. They are fast and furious when processing data. This rings true: younger folks are fast on emails, blogs, wikis&hellip; whereas older ones, non-techie, needs time to swallow information. Of course, this means that tech natives are somewhat more shallow in their processing of the information, but I&rsquo;d argue that being shallow is needed, it is our way to adapt. You choose when to be deep.



I think speed is the critical issue. The tech native understand that things need to go very fast, always.

This makes me hopeful: we might see a reversal of the ever increasing bureaucracy one day soon.
