Those of you who have broadband and are interested in having more details about the SCTIC-CREPUQ Meeting I described earlier, you can get Stephen Downes&rsquo; slides and audio stream on Object Oriented Learning Objects:

>Slides and the MP3 audio (English and French, 7 megabytes) of my presentation in Montreal are now available (the audio also includes the<br/>
presentations from other panelists, used with permission). In it, I present again the idea of &ldquo;e-learning as dynamic, unstructured stream of learning resources obtained and organized by learners.&rdquo; In this talk I extend the idea bit by elaborating on the community aspect of learning resources and outlining how the learning objects should be designed in order to facilitate this. More &#8211; much more &#8211; on this in the future.
