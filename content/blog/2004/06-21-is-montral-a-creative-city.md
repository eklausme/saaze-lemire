title: "Is Montréal a creative city?"
---



This morning, I went out and decided to do some research on the city where I live from a [creative class](http://www.creativeclass.com/) point of view. I found two reports. One by Richard Florida himself on [Canadian cities](http://www.creativeclass.com/). The report was paid for by Ontario, but it looks objective. Second of all, I found a report by the department of Canadian Heritage on attracting talent in Canada.

What comes out of these reports is that __Montréal is not a very creative city__. It more creative than the Canadian average, but well below Vancouver and Toronto. However, it is definitively a tech. center, it actually surpass both Toronto and Vancouver in terms of being a technopolis. Florida&rsquo;s report point out though that these figures might be misleading: a lot of tech. workers in Montréal work in the aerospace industry and their job might be in a tech. industry, but it is unclear how much technology is involved in their work. There are creative and talented people in Montréal, but according to the Heritage Canada report, they are poor if not starving.
