A large number of organizations are exploiting the opportunities offered by Internet-based technologies for electronic commerce and electronic business. Companies sell and purchase via the Internet, search engines and directories allow electronic market participants around the globe to locate potential trading partners, and a set of protocols and standards has been established to exchange goods and services via the Internet. The Internet is changing the way how companies and organizations are working, and the amount of innovation and change seems to accelerate. However, numerous technical issues need still to be resolved. The main objective of this conference is to bring together researchers and practitioners from different disciplines, all<br/>
interested in electronic commerce and Web technologies and to assess current methodologies and new research directions. Although a natural focus will be on computer science issues, we welcome research contributions from economics, business administration, law, and other disciplines. EC-Web 2005 is organized by the DEXA Association in parallel with DEXA 2005 (16th International Conference on Database and Expert Systems Applications).
