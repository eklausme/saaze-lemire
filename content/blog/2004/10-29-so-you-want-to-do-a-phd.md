[Seb](http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/) sent me this extract of a book. The extract is called [So, you want to do a Ph.D.?](http://www.mheducation.co.uk/openup/chapters/0335213448.pdf) As usual with this sort of book, it is delightful.

Here&rsquo;s a fun quote:

>One thing which is seldom mentioned is what happens to you after you finish the PhD. A classic story is as follows. A student focuses clearly, submits the thesis and starts looking for a lecturing job, only to discover that they need two years of lecturing experience and preferably a journal publication as well if they are to be appointable for a job in a good department in their field. If they had known this two years previously, they could have started doing some part-time lecturing and submitted a paper or two to a journal.


I haven&rsquo;t read the entire book, of course, and I&rsquo;m somewhat worried that the book might not be sufficiently focused on <b>why</b> one does a Ph.D. and might be a tad too cynical. Learning the rules is very nice and very important, and I wished I had learned them when it was time. However, there is also the issue of figuring out whether these rules make sense, and knowing when to break them. Well, I guess that learning the rules to begin with is a very good start.
