<p>I think that students have been learning calculus with little input from teachers for a long time. Teaching the course, I&rsquo;ve often felt that there was no way that the vast majority of my students could possibly be getting much out of my lessons &#8211; it was only through working on the problems that they learned the material. Perhaps this is just end-of-the-term frustration speaking, but I often find myself wondering if we should just do away with the 3 lecture hours per week and present our students with a good set of notes and a well-staffed tutorial centre. An online course approximates that reasonably well, so perhaps its time has come.</p>
<p>Either that or universities just aren&rsquo;t &ldquo;doing calculus&rdquo; right. </p>
<p>Naaaaahhhh.</p>
