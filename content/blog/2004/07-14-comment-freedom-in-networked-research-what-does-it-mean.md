<p>I think research is collecting, organizing and storing information.</p>

<p>I agree with you that it is a valid definition. But it isn&rsquo;t what I do for a living. What you describe is more like journalistic research, or library research&#8230; When I write &ldquo;research&rdquo;, I mean the &ldquo;research *I* do&rdquo;. Sorry to sound egocentric&#8230; but there is no other way to put it.</p>
<p>Collecting and organizing information is part of what I do, and hopefully, part of my contribution to society, but the research I do involves creativity and it involves the network.</p>
<p>Oh&#8230; where to start&#8230; I don&rsquo;t even want to try to propose a definition of what research is&#8230; I&rsquo;m not even sure it is possible.</p>
