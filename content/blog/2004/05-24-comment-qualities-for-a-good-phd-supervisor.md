<p>That is the ideal situation. How many professors in the world who have a student<br/>
being professor at Harvard? How many students have the chance to get the professors<br/>
they want? Who can control their fate?</p>

<p>At least in North America, students get to choose their supervisors. Good students, at least.</p>
<p>Second of all, one prof. cares about his students and tries to help them, they will, statistically, do better than the students from the prof. who couldn&rsquo;t care less. You can measure such things by looking at where are the students of your prospective supervisor.</p>
<p>This is like choosing a job. The first thing you should do when choosing a job is to look at how well the employees are doing where you want to work. Same applies when choosing a supervisor.</p>
<p>This only one element on my list, of course.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m just telling students: spend an extra day or so choosing your supervisor and it be worth years of your life later.</p>

<p>Just found this entry in my referral logs, and boy, do I ever wish someone had told me this when I was starting my degree. Would have saved me over two years with an advisor who &#8230;well, who fails on all counts above.</p>
