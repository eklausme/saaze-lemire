---



Once in a while, you find something on the Web that makes you go &ldquo;Wow!&rdquo;. Ever since MathML came along, I&rsquo;ve been fairly disappointed because it looked like it was designed to work only inside expensive commercial tools. [ASCIIMathML](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/mathml/asciimath.html) proves I was wrong. You can write standard HTML files with some convenient mathematical notation in it, and a piece of JavaScript will dynamically convert it to MathML which displays fairly nicely in Firefox. However, I always seem to be missing some key fonts.

<em>XML and JavaScript are a potent mix.</em>
