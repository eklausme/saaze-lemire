title: "Globalization and the American IT Worker"

Norman Matloff wrote a solid paper called [Globalization and the American IT Worker](http://heather.cs.ucdavis.edu/CACM.pdf), published in the latest issue (Nov. 2004) of Communications of the ACM. Here&rsquo;s a rather bleak quote:

>  University computer science departments must be<br/>
honest with students regarding career opportunities<br/>
in the field. The reduction in programming jobs<br/>
open to U.S. citizens and green card holders is per-<br/>
manent, not just a dip in the business cycle. Students<br/>
who want technological work must have less of a<br/>
mindset on programming and put more effort into<br/>
understanding computer systems in preparation for<br/>
jobs not easily offshored (such as system and data-<br/>
base administrators). For instance, how many gradu-<br/>
ates can give a cogent explanation of how an OS<br/>
boots up?
