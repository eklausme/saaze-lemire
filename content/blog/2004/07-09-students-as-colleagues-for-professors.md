[Stephen](http://www.downes.ca) gave an interview to Clientology about eLearning.

Some of his statements should be scaring the h*ll out of some people in universities and elsewhere. First, he points out that gatekeepers are slowly losing their power:

>It is important to recall how much of our culture &#8211; including political culture, economic culture, educational culture &#8212; has been shaped by &lsquo;gatekeepers&rsquo;, elites who, because of their knowledge and position, are the sole arbiters of what we will read, buy or learn. This gatekeeping function has already been disintermediated; new people &#8212; what Robin Good calls the &lsquo;newsmaster&rsquo; are taking their place, and the result is a much more balanced exchange.



This is so obvious in my daily life and was brought on by the Internet and excellent tools like Google. It actually links with a previous post I wrote this week: non-tech natives are the gatekeeper generation. The new tech natives won&rsquo;t see a purpose for these gatekeepers who kept their knowledge close and their power even closer. Information and knowledge is always changing and flowing so that controlling knowledge doesn&rsquo;t make sense anymore. In a very deep way, we&rsquo;ve become a dynamic society. This is not just class mobility, that is, the ability for a large segment of the population to acquire some key knowledge and then, have a shot at becoming a gatekeeper. No. I think that the notion of gatekeeper itself is failing.

This has very concrete consequences in universities:

>In education, the result is the gradual erosion of the power relationship that existed between student and professor. In some senses, we see this already by the designation by many of the student as &lsquo;customer&rsquo; rather than, say, apprentice. But it&rsquo;s deeper than that, and we will see eventually the designation of student as &lsquo;colleague&rsquo; &#8212; and in an important sense, it will not be possible to distinguish between student and professor online.



I couldn&rsquo;t agree more. Students do not depend on their professors the same way they use to. Professors won&rsquo;t be able to hold their status as gatekeepers for very long now. Not when anyone in the planet can quickly become an expert in almost any field just by reading up on the Internet.

I think university professors will remain marketing tools. First, they will serve to sell training, which they have always done anyhow, and second, they will be used to authentify knowledge which will become an increasingly important task. Students won&rsquo;t look so much for knowledge but for recognition and professors who can bring student some recognition which will be in high demand.
