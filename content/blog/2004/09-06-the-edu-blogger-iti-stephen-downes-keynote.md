From the wish-I-was-there Department, here&rsquo;s a [review of Stephen Downes&rsquo;](https://edu-blogger.blogspot.com/2004/09/iti-stephen-downes-keynote.html) keynote at ITI.

There are few people that can be called &ldquo;visionary&rdquo;. I&rsquo;ve met very few. Very few can pass my tests over and over because often, you discover they had one idea and the rest is just fluff or posturing. Stephen is the real thing. That doesn&rsquo;t mean he makes a lot of friends in the way. However, maybe the people who should listen to him just don&rsquo;t understand him and that&rsquo;s why he doesn&rsquo;t get shot.
