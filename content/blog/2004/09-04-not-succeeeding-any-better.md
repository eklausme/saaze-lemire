Here&rsquo;s a quote from [a post by James Robertson](http://www.cincomsmalltalk.com/main/community/resources/smalltalk-blogs/):

>  If you make sure that you do exactly what the other guys do,<br/>
you have made a risk averse decision &#8211; you won&rsquo;t fail any worse than they do,<br/>
but you also won&rsquo;t succeed any better.
