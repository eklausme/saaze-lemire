Stephen wrote an article: Whither the Semantic Web. We agree so much that you&rsquo;d think I steal my good ideas from him (I do). 

Semantic Web researchers need to realize that the Semantic Web is happening now. But it isn&rsquo;t happening where they think. My blog, my entire web site, is described using simple, accessible XML in a RSS format and useful software access it now. Millions of people do the same, either because they are technically capable or by using existing some of the great software out there, much of it free.

On the other hand, the W3C is in a sea of insanity with specifications adopted merely for their political merits, certainly not because they&rsquo;ve proven themselves to be useful. Don&rsquo;t get me wrong: some of XPath and XSLT is truly useful. DTDs are useful. But then, things like [OWL](http://www.w3.org/TR/owl-features/)? Please! I&rsquo;ve seen no demonstration that such sophisticated specs are actually usable in the real world. Yes, people are lazy and stupid: take it into account when designing new technology.

I think that a lot of this insanity is motivated by researcher&rsquo;s need for difficult and complex problems to justify their existence. After all, if Joe in his tavern can understand your problem and your solution, it can&rsquo;t be very serious research.

Let complexity be thy guide.
