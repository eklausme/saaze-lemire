title: "Tim Bray opposing Web Services"

Tim Bray who invented XML among other things, takes [a stand against Web Services](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/09/18/WS-Oppo). Here&rsquo;s what he says:

>No matter how hard I try, I still think the WS-* stack is bloated, opaque, and insanely complex. I think it&rsquo;s going to be hard to understand, hard to implement, hard to interoperate, and hard to secure.

I look at Google and Amazon and EBay and Salesforce and see them doing tens of millions of transactions a day involving pumping XML back and forth over HTTP, and I can&rsquo;t help noticing that they don&rsquo;t seem to need much WS-apparatus.

I&rsquo;m deeply suspicious of &ldquo;standards&rdquo; built by committees in advance of industry experience, and I&rsquo;m deeply suspicious of Microsoft and IBM, and I&rsquo;m deeply suspicious of multiple layers of abstraction that try to get between me and the messages full of angle-bracketed text that I push around to get work done.



It should be noted that Tim has recently taken a job with Sun Microsystems. His current employer is very actively involved in Web Services, so I believe he takes this stand despite the current interest of his employer.
