Here&rsquo;s an interesting paper by [Hassan Masum](http://http-server.carleton.ca/~hmasum/), [TOOL: The Open Opinion Layer](http://firstmonday.org/ojs/index.php/fm/issue/view/147). Here&rsquo;s the abstract:

Shared opinions drive society: what we read, how we vote, and where we shop are all heavily influenced by the choices of others. However, the cost in time and money to systematically share opinions remains high, while the actual performance history of opinion generators is often not tracked.

This article explores the development of a distributed open opinion layer, which is given the generic name of TOOL. Similar to the evolution of network protocols as an underlying layer for many computational tasks, we suggest that TOOL has the potential to become a common substrate upon which many scientific, commercial, and social activities will be based.

Valuation decisions are ubiquitous in human interaction and thought itself. Incorporating information valuation into a computational layer will be as significant a step forward as our current communication and information retrieval layers.
