title: "Cool RDF tools"
---



RDF is everywhere it seems: from Dublin Core to RSS, all to way to FOAF&hellip; However, it can be quite painful to parse. Cool tools are starting to emerge however, but google is not yet very good at finding them.

Suppose you have a RDF/XML representation and you want the triples&hellip; go to [W3C RDF Validation Service](http://www.w3.org/RDF/Validator/) and it will do it nicely for you.

On the other hand, the form on [this page](http://www.w3.org/DesignIssues/Notation3.html) allows you to go from [N3 (the user friendly RDF syntax)](http://www.w3.org/2000/10/swap/Primer) to RDF/XML.
