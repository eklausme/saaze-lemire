What is one of the most visited page on all of my sites? It is &ldquo;Jolie, petite coquine&rdquo;, the Web page of our cat. The page was originally designed by my wife back when she had a Web site of her own. The page ranks high on [Voila](http://www.voila.fr) for some [sex bound keyword searches](http://search.ke.voila.fr/S/voila?rtype=kw&#038;profil=voila&#038;bhv=web_fr&#038;rdata=jolie+coquine) and people arrive at my cat&rsquo;s page because they are horny. Now, that&rsquo;s at least 10 hits per day. How come Google doesn&rsquo;t fall short the same way? I don&rsquo;t know, but somehow, Google knows my cat isn&rsquo;t a sex object&hellip;

Or is she? Well, check it out for yourself!

Note: in doing research for this post, I found out that [dmoz.org](http://www.dmoz.org) actually indexes various sex sites in a taxonomy. But my cat is nowhere to be found.
