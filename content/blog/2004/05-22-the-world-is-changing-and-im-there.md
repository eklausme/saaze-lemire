title: "The world is changing, and IÂ´m there!"
---



Tonight, I really feel like the world is changing. 

The typical problem scientists and scholars in general have is that we need to be able to predict paradigms changes, or at least study them. But how can you know that things are changing while you are in it? Can humans study humans? Well, I&rsquo;m not a social scientist, so I don&rsquo;t have to worry, officially, with such issues&hellip; but all scholars are affected to some level by this paradox.

Well, I&rsquo;ve been using [inDiscover.net](http://www.indiscover.net). Yes, I&rsquo;m linking to my own project, well, it isn&rsquo;t <b>my</b> project, but I&rsquo;m involved from the side. So, it is self-promotion. Fine. Still, using [inDiscover.net](http://www.indiscover.net) has made me realized how the world has changed. A bit like when [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca) worked on his MuniMall portal project and, while the project was a failure, he realized that the world was changing and he embarked on a mission (see his value statement on his site). 

Look on the right-hand-side of my blog, you should see my current playlist from [inDiscover.net](http://www.indiscover.net). All of this music is free. It is out there. You can download the MP3s and listen to the same music I listen to. No matter where you are in the world. You can then share your playlist with the world. You can have my playlist, live, as XML, that you can incorporate in any application, any web site.

I hope to write later on why I think this is a paradigm shift. We are beyond the world of blogs, beyond the Web&hellip; this is deep. I think it will eventually change society all the way. 

Ok, I&rsquo;m making many claims here&hellip; I need to write this up, but it is late&hellip;
