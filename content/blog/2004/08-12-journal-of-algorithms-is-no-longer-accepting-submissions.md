title: "Journal of Algorithms is no longer accepting submissions"
---



We just submited an article to the Journal of Algorithms and we were told that starting in 2003, the editors have stopped accepting papers. One alternative appears to be [ACM Transactions on Algorithms](http://www.acm.org/talg/).

[It seems like the entire board of the Journal of Algorithms had resigned some time ago](http://www.cs.colorado.edu/~hal/s.pdf). I had no idea that Elsevier and other big publishers were in such troubles. I had heard about the [Journal of Machine Learning](http://www.ai.mit.edu/projects/jmlr/)&hellip; 

It feels like soon, all the big journals will have moved to an open or semi-open setup. Very scary for big publishers. Very scary. Yes, they&rsquo;ve been making ever larger profits, but it may all come down to a stop really soon. Tipping point coming!
