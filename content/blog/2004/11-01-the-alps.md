Found an interesting UK Indie Rock bad on [inDiscover](http://www.indiscover.net): [The Alps.](http://www.indiscover.net/) They have a number of freely available songs, but I only listened to &ldquo;The Shining&rdquo;.

There are also some new bands to explore on [inDiscover](http://www.indiscover.net): [Steel Poniez](http://www.indiscover.net/) (bunch of ladies) and [School for the Dead](http://www.indiscover.net/) (bunch of dudes).
