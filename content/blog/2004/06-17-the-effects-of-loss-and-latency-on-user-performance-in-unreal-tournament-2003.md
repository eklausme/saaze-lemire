title: "The Effects of Loss and Latency on User Performance in Unreal Tournament 2003"
---



The following page points to some research on the impact of latency on gamers and, in particular, on recent research involving Unreal Tournament:[The Effects of Loss and Latency on User Performance in Unreal Tournament 2003](http://www.cs.wpi.edu/~claypool/papers/ut2003/).

I think this is an absolutely great way to attract students: do research on gaming technology. In fact, I once proposed to NRC that I could do some research on Web porn technology, but my boss (Bruce Spencer) seemed reluctant for some reason to invest government dollars in the porn industry.

I still haven&rsquo;t given up on using porn technology as a research topic though. However, I think that just like gaming, you&rsquo;d need to work extra-hard just to justify your research topic.

Which is not to say that my research is not on cool topics. I think that [inDiscover](http://www.indiscover.net) is quite cool. I also have other things coming that may appear as sexy to some people (but no porn research as of yet).

Just like art, I think that research should be thought provoking.
