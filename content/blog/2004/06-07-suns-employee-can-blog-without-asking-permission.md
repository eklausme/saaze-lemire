title: "SunÂ´s employee can blog without asking permission"
---



I like Tim Bray. He gave us so many great things and I&rsquo;m sure he will help Sun. I&rsquo;ve learned through [OLDaily](http://www.downes.ca/) that Sun&rsquo;s employees can now [blog](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2004/06/06/BSC) without asking permission. This is quite clear: if you want to comment on today&rsquo;s technology or on your daily work, go right ahead. You don&rsquo;t need to ask your boss first as to whether you can say that or this. I would imagine that company secrets have to remain off the blogs, but such &ldquo;secrets&rdquo; are usually quite boring anyway and not what employees would want to write about, and a large company like Sun cannot hold secrets very well anyhow.

To be fair, many Microsoft employees have done this too, and with support from Microsoft. Again, these companies encourage open communication and thus, creativity. They cannot lose.
