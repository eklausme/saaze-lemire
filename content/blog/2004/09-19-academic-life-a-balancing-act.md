title: "Academic life: a balancing act"
---



Today, I realized that the life of a researcher/professor is really a balancing act. A professor&hellip;

- has a rich personal life;
- gives great courses;
- gets a lot of funding;
- has many students;
- publishes a lot papers each year;
- consults on industrial/governmental projects;
- manages something (departement, project, program).


It is no surprise that many professors end up being overworked. I think you simply cannot pull all these things at once. Maybe 2 or 3 from the list. You have to choose or life will choose for you.
