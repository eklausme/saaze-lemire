<p>The point is you may never become a great researcher. In some sense, we are all in<br/>
this category if you put yourself in the stream of time or in the scale of<br/>
the globe. Then, what do you do if you still want to have a career and to establish some status or influence, even if you recognize that you are not a first class researcher? Funding is a game to play.<br/>
With funding, you can say that you are a researcher been recognized, though you are not so great.<br/>
Funding is also one index of market &#8212; the trend of the investment in science and technology.<br/>
It is like the investment in movies. You are a great actor for Shakespare plays, but<br/>
it is not in the trend anymore (maybe). So you will be a great but lonely actor for your life. I would do both,<br/>
to be a great actor, and stay in trend. If you are not so talent, try to be a pop star :).<br/>
To win a best paper reward, to get funding may not be the goals of the scitenific carreer. But they are the targets.</p>

<p>I think that John Travolta was a pop star at the very beginning of his career. He also did not go into plays.</p>
<p>I believe you can become a great research while participating in fashionable research trends&#8230; however, what is your goal? If your goal is only to hop on the next trend, and get money and publish lots of papers, you will never grow&#8230; and so, you&rsquo;ll always be at point zero, doing the same thing all over again, and again, and again&#8230; as with all new trends, you&rsquo;ll start again, publish lots of papers, get lots of funding.</p>
<p>Is that all there is?</p>
<p>I think you should have a more noble goal for yourself.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s true. You&rsquo;ve got to do it for the subject itself.</p>
