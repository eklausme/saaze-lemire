Here is a very important report:Entering the Mainstream: The Quality and Extent of Online Education in the United States, 2003 and 2004

This study takes a look at online learning in American Universities. Here&rsquo;s a few facts the study brings to bare.

> 
__Will online enrollments continue their rapid growth?__

- Over 1.9 million students were studying online in the fall of 2003.- Schools expect the number of online students to grow to over 2.6 million by the fall of 2004.- Schools expect online enrollment growth to accelerate â€” the expected average growth rate for online students for 2004 is 24.8%, up from 19.8% in 2003.- Overall, schools were pretty accurate in predicting enrollment growth â€” last year&rsquo;s predicted online enrollment for 2003 was 1,920,734; this year&rsquo;s number from the survey is 1,971,397.

__Are students as satisfied with online courses as they are with face-to-face instruction?__

- 40.7% of schools offering online courses agree that &ldquo;students are at least as satisfied&rdquo; with their online courses, 56.2% are neutral and only 3.1% disagree.


__<br/>
What about the quality of online offerings, do schools continue to believe that it measures up?<br/>
__

- A majority of academic leaders believe that online learning quality is already equal to or superior to face-to-face instruction.- Three quarters of academic leaders at public colleges and universities believe that online learning quality is equal to or superior to face-to-face instruction.
- Three quarters of all academic leaders believe that online learning quality will be equal to or superior to face-to-face instruction in three years.



In light of these facts, recall my earlier [prediction](/lemire/blog/2004/11/14/sebastien-paquet-on-blogs-and-wikis/):

>I predict that in 5 years, students all over the world will learn Calculus with little input from from instructors (but a lot of input from other students!). They will use sophisticated on-line laboratories and on-line testing, and on-line support. The technology is already here, but we still don&rsquo;t know how to use it properly.


It looks like it might happen even faster than 5 years! But my prediction is bold enough as it is, so I&rsquo;ll keep it in its current form.
