title: "What defines leadership?"
---



Yuhong&rsquo;s [new blog talks about leadership](https://flydragony.blogspot.com/2004/06/conflicts-and-opportunities.html). She quite accurately points out that in research, as in all creative work, leadership is a very important quality. I&rsquo;ve struggled myself with the concept while I was filling out funding applications (yes, I&rsquo;m still working on funding). People ask you to prove you are a leader&hellip; but what does it mean to be a leader?

Yuhong proposes the following definition:

- Always take into account everyone&rsquo;s interest
- Be generous
- Have a vision


I like Yuhong&rsquo;s definition!
