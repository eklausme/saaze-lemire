<p>I think fear is a healthy composure to have sometimes but not complete fear where you&rsquo;ve lost control. It starts without assessing the situation with logic. I feel this way sometimes but I am only just finding out what road I have taken. Fear can eventually consume you in its dinosaur jaws. There is an option, a spear of logic an belief that can slay the beast of primal fear.</p>
