title: "Does your university think that &#8220;Jobs are for the little people&#8221;?"

Tall, Dark, and Mysterious is a Math. professor somewhere in Canada, possibly in British Columbia. She graduated from a big school and now teaches at a smaller (lesser?) school.
Well, is it a lesser school? That&rsquo;s where her tale becomes interesting. Myself, I attended [UofT](http://www.utoronto.ca/). I don&rsquo;t know if the rule is true, probably not, but it seem that the larger the school, the more it suffers from the jobs-are-for-little-people syndrome as documented in a post by Tall, Dark, and Mysterious. Here is an insightful quote:

>University isn&rsquo;t job training, because universities are adamant about university not being job training. And it&rsquo;s not because they&rsquo;re too busy enriching students&rsquo; lives and fostering a love of learning. Underneath all of the cheap idealism &#8211; trumpeted by gainfully employed people, many of whom haven&rsquo;t learned how to play a musical insturment, how to speak a foreign language, or how to play a new sport because none of those things are related to their jobs and because they&rsquo;re too old to be doing that sort of thing &#8211; about learning for the sake of learning is a willful inability to confront the fact that students are not at universities to learn for the sake of learning.
