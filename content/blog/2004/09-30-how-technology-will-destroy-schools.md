title: "How Technology Will Destroy Schools"
---



Through [Downes&rsquo;](http://www.downes.ca), I found an article by David Wiley&rsquo;s with the provocative title How Technology Will Destroy Schools (he actually is being needlessly provocative, he means &ldquo;schools as they exist now&rdquo;). The gist of his argument goes as follows:

> The development of (&hellip;) technology will obviate the need for certain types of instruction &#8212; like the teaching of facts. Why spend time memorizing when the same information is available just as quickly from the network as it is from your own memory? But never fear, schools! The technology will create the need for new types of instruction &#8212; in higher level information literacy skills. Perhaps this will finally force some change through the public schools.


Well, I must admit. I have a Ph.D. in mathematics and I never learned my multiplication tables. There you go. I never saw the point of learning these tables, so I didn&rsquo;t. Instead, I learned a few tricks to do multiplications&hellip; like 9 times 8 is almost 10 times 8, you have to subtract 1 times 8.

Mathematics is not about learning facts. I suspect that all disciplines have a component above learning the facts. You can&rsquo;t be an expert in something if you only know the facts&hellip; because I can easily input the facts into a piece of software and compete with you, but we all know that software can&rsquo;t compete (yet) against human experts. I&rsquo;m not very good at memorizing facts, I&rsquo;ve never been good at it. In fact, I&rsquo;m not good at memorizing anything and that&rsquo;s why I have a PDA always with me. Yet, I&rsquo;m in expert at some things.

It is the difference between real knowledge and shallow knowledge. Most of our education system is based on acquiring and testing shallow knowledge. Most but not all.

How are you going to get past shallow knowledge through technology as Wiley predicts we will? I think that blogs, games, and simulations are good examples. Yes, we can role play without technology, but it becomes so much cheaper to deploy gaming scenarios through technology (because you only have to do it once) that it might become more common place in the future.

Maybe my son Lohan, by the time he makes it to school, will have &ldquo;gaming instruction&rdquo; where he will enter a gaming universe to learn basic mathematics. Who knows.

I&rsquo;m not holding my breath though, I think we lack the human power to do pull it off in the next 5 years.
