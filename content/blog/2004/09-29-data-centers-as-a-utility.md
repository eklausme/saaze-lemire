title: "Data centers as a utility?"

Seems like Gartner predicts data centers are going to [become a utility](http://technews.acm.org/#item9):

> 
The office environment will dramatically change in 50 years&rsquo; time, with desktop computers disappearing, robots handling more manual tasks, and global connectivity enabling more intercontinental collaboration. Data centers located outside the city will run powerful database and processing applications, serving up computing power as a utility; many more people will work remotely, using handheld devices to stay connected wherever they go, although those devices will be much more sophisticated and easier to use than current handhelds.
