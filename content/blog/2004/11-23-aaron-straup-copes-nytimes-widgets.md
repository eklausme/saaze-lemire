One of the most interesting talk we had at SWIG&rsquo;04 was &ldquo;Design Issues and Technical Challenges Making the Eatdrinkfeelgood Markup Language RDF&rdquo; where Aaron showed why it was hard to use RDF in a XML project. I think it all boils down to the fact that we have no good widespread way of serializing RDF to XML. In any case, Aaron finally sent me a link to his [NYTimes Widgets](http://www.aaronland.info/nytimes/).

It lacks sufficient documentation for me to grok it quickly, but from what I understand, Aaron tried to create a useful and innovative RDF application. Here&rsquo;s what he says about his widgets:

>The New York Times includes a large amount of topical metadata with each article it publishes. These are widgets that, having harvested the data, try to do something interesting with it.
