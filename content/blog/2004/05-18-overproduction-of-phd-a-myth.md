title: "Overproduction of Ph.D. a myth?"

According to Owen, or maybe, according to what I understand from his email, overproduction of Ph.D.s is a myth. Schools can&rsquo;t get decent Ph.D. holders.

True. Maybe.

Owen has evidence: [CRA Stats](http://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/).

More precisely, according [to this table](http://cra.org/), 60% of CS Ph.D. holders go to a Ph.D. granting university (on a tenure-track or not?), 4% to a non-Ph.D. granting school, and 29% go in industry. A meagre 2% join the government, and 1% and self-employed.
