We are still at the very beginning. In the first phase, Nicolas will be investigating which blog engine is best for this particular use. In the second phase, we&rsquo;ll need to setup tools for information analysis and aggregation to support the community.

While this is a small, local initiative, we are doing something to push eLearning forward! If we can help tutors with blogging, then this will be a good step toward giving [UQAM](http://www.uqam.ca/) students blogs&hellip; (warning: this is blue sky thinking)

On a related topic, [Nicolas](https://accounts.google.com/ServiceLogin?service=blogger&amp;hl=en&amp;passive=1209600&amp;continue=https://www.blogger.com/blogin.g?blogspotURL%3Dhttp://appcoll.blogspot.com/2004/12/petit-exercice-de-dmystification.html%26zx%3Dt3x657fcl6yg&amp;ltmpl=private) (in French) talks about how he intends to learn about RSS even though he is not a computer scientist.

This tells me something: RSS is to Semantic Web (for lack of a better term) what HTML is to the Web. HTML was a technical format never meant for non-technical people, yet, designers all over the world have learned HTML and learned it well. HTML was simple and limited, but it was enough. RSS is the same: it was meant for a few Netscape engineers and now, everyone from the average lawyer to the sociologist is studying the RSS formats. RSS is simple and limited, but it is powerful enough for separating content from presentation on the Web.
