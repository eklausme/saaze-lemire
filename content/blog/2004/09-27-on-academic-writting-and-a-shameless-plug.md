title: "On tools for academic writting and a shameless plug"

First, the shameless plug: my long-time friend, Jean-FranÃ§ois Racine published a book available both as [hardcover](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/9004130764/104-4614935-7471942?v=glance&#038;s=books) and [paperback](https://www.amazon.com/exec/obidos/tg/detail/-/1589831160/qid=1096304328/sr=8-1/ref=sr_8_xs_ap_i1_xgl14/104-4614935-7471942?v=glance&#038;s=books&#038;n=507846). The title is &ldquo;The Text of Matthew in the Writings of Basil of Caesarea&rdquo;.

More seriously, and maybe he had told me about this, but he told me about this specialized word processor he uses, called [Nota Bene](http://www.notabene.com/). More interesting is a component of this word processor called Orbis. Specifically, Orbis generates vocabulary lists, as well as frequency of occurrence; and it allows you to define synonym lists to expand search capabilities.
