<p>It is easy to be an opposition, without providing alternative. He waits to see WS-* fail and then to claim he is the one foresee it. That is just a proof that He is a pessimist, and there is no other better solution to provide the same functions. Every good thing will be over-used and vulgarized by na√Øve people who believe new tools have all-powerful magic. You can see the same thing in academics. When a newly invented theory emerges, people use it everywhere and on all kind of problems. I saw Neural Networks, Genetic Algorithms, .. are like this. Now their trends went away. But they are important.</p>
