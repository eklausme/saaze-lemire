title: "Job prospects for new Ph.D.s are good?"

This time, I found stats for [Philosophy Ph.D.s](http://clients.yourmembership.com/dns_error.asp?fqdn=www%2Eapa%2Eudel%2Eedu). It would appear that the ratio of candidates to job advertize is shrinking quite a bit. I got this from [Leiter Reports](https://login.utexas.edu:443/login/cdcservlet?goto=https%3A%2F%2Fwikis.utexas.edu%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D4CFCC74EE557925200DC4C6AE1ED665E%3Fos_destination%3D%252Fpages%252Fviewpage.action%253Ftitle%253DDeveloper%252BResources%2526spaceKey%253DDeveloperResources&amp;RequestID=1503077965&amp;MajorVersion=1&amp;MinorVersion=0&amp;ProviderID=https%3A%2F%2Fwikis.utexas.edu%3A443%2Famagent%3FRealm%3D%2Fadmin%2Fwcs-realm&amp;IssueInstant=2015-11-24T10%3A41%3A44Z). In the same blog, we find [evidence that 9 out 10 Philosophy Ph.D.s](https://login.utexas.edu:443/login/cdcservlet?goto=https%3A%2F%2Fwikis.utexas.edu%2Flogin.action%3Bjsessionid%3D3E75B31518A022879A0641844284B1EE%3Fos_destination%3D%252Fpages%252Fviewpage.action%253Ftitle%253DDeveloper%252BResources%2526spaceKey%253DDeveloperResources&amp;RequestID=2146505647&amp;MajorVersion=1&amp;MinorVersion=0&amp;ProviderID=https%3A%2F%2Fwikis.utexas.edu%3A443%2Famagent%3FRealm%3D%2Fadmin%2Fwcs-realm&amp;IssueInstant=2015-11-24T10%3A41%3A56Z) get a cool middle-class job, assuming they went to Princeton.

Well, there seems to be a lot more evidence than I thought that things are improving for new Ph.D.s

As it turns out, though, my claims are also supported by anedotes: Fang and Nielsen.
