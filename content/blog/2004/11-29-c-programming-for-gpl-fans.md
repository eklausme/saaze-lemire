Looks like GPL is an ever expanding world. Through [slashdot](http://slashdot.org/), I learned that there is GPL IDE for C# called [SharpDevelop](http://www.icsharpcode.net/OpenSource/SD/). Given that there is nothing wrong, apparently, with C# as a language, maybe I&rsquo;ll need this one day. It is also [being ported to Mono](http://www.monodevelop.com/) so it should eventually run under Linux too.
