<p>I&rsquo;ll try to learn RSS with the tutorials available on the web, but maybe i&rsquo;ll need your help a little though. i got rssview (beta version) last friday, tried to run it but hit a roadblock when i realised that i may need a bit of php knowledge. Maybe it&rsquo;s not the case, and there are surely simpler programs for RSS than this one. Anyway, i&rsquo;ll probably get it with further investigation.</p>
