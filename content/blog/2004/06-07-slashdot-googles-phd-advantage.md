title: "Slashdot | Google´s Ph.D. Advantage"

Interesting post on slashdot on [Google&rsquo;s Ph.D. Advantage](http://tech.slashdot.org/story/04/06/07/1030205/googles-phd-advantage). It would appear that: 

> 
Google&rsquo;s willingness to let every employee spend 20% of his or her time on an independent project is a compelling motivator and that they estimate that Google has as many Ph.D.&rsquo;s working for it as Microsoft, which is 30 times larger.



What&rsquo;s interesting to me is that Google has a distinctive culture and everyone has felt it. It is hard to describe really, but the minute people tried to use Google, they discovered that it wasn&rsquo;t just another search engine driven by business people who focused on the business case. And you know what? It has only gotten better over time. Some say that the dot-bust and generally depressing state of the industrial R&#038;D won&rsquo;t be with us for very long, that we will rebound. I think that despite everything we can think, Information Technology will still be a very good place to be just because this is what most people have trouble with: managing information and knowledge. If you work in any kind of organisation, I&rsquo;m sure your days are filled with questions such as &ldquo;where can I find this, who knows about this?&rdquo;. I know my days are like that. That&rsquo;s why I use email so much. That&rsquo;s why I have a wiki, a cvs server, and a blog&hellip; and that&rsquo;s why I keep on exploring new ways to manage data&hellip; because all of these techniques extend the reach of my brain and, to put it bluntly, they do make me smarter.

There aren&rsquo;t too many job offers where a Ph.D. is considered a plus and unless you want a job in academia or are willing to start a company, if you want to remain in Canada, your Ph.D. might not give you a strong edge (though I don&rsquo;t know for sure). A search on [monster.ca](http://www.monster.ca) reveals that there are 19 job offers in Canada with Ph.D. in the description. Not all of those are for Ph.D. holders though. For example Google is looking for a sales coordinator (Toronto) but they only mention that the founders had Ph.D.s. I&rsquo;d say it is more like 10ish job offers in all of Canada.

Call me an optimist, but I think the days when business turns back to innovation for growth have to come back really soon. Google shows that an innovation-driven business can work. It can compete with the largest beasts like Microsoft, at least for a time. I want to believe in the [rise of the creative class](http://www.creativeclass.com/): wealth is mostly provided by creativity and creativity comes from creative people. My only worry is whether this will happen in Canada and in Montréal in particular. I just don&rsquo;t know. Some people tell me that industry is really vibrant in Montréal right now. I haven&rsquo;t been back long enough to know. I need to go downtown a bit more. I need to find out where the creative people are in this city.
