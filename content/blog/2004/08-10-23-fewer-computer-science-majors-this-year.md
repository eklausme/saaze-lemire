title: "23% Fewer Computer Science Majors This Year!"
---



Slashdot reports on a [USA Today article](http://www.usatoday.com/tech/news/2004-08-08-computer-science_x.htm) saying that there [fewer Computer Science Majors](http://slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=04/08/10/130259&#038;tid=146&#038;tid=1&#038;tid=218). They cite a 23% decline in enrollment in North America. Here&rsquo;s one comment about the article:

> 
Most engineering schools are reporting declines in enrollment. This is hardly surprising since most engineering curriculums, including CS, are difficult compared to other fields of study. Without the prospect of a good job waiting for them, many college students are veering away from these majors.



Update: [Yuhong](https://flydragony.blogspot.com/) correctly points out that this is mostly at the undegraduate level. Graduate schools are finding enough students, at least according to Yuhong. I think this is expected: if job prospects are bad, people won&rsquo;t enter the system but once they&rsquo;ve entered it, they will stay in it longer if jobs are scarse.
