title: "Use of blogs in higher education"
---



Through [Downes&rsquo;](http://www.downes.ca), I found this great paper on Exploring the user of blogs as learning spaces in the higher education sector.

Looks like a great paper:

>This paper explores the potential of blogs as learning spaces for students in the higher education sector. It refers to the nascent literature on the subject, explores methods for using blogs for educational purposes in university courses (eg. Harvard Law School), and records the experience of the Brisbane Graduate School of Business at Queensland University of Technology, with its &lsquo;MBA blog&rsquo;. The paper concludes that blogging has the potential to be a transformational technology for teaching and learning.
