I&rsquo;ve finally moved all my machines to [Mozilla Firefox 1.0](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/new/). It is, by far, the __best browser__ I ever used, and it is totally, truely free. Unfortunately, the [French version](http://www.frenchmozilla.fr/) is lagging behind a bit. Unless you are running something else than Windows, Linux, or MacOS, you have no excuse to use another browser. None.

Update: Sean asks why I switched away from Konqueror. The main reasons are XML support and Gmail. Gmail doesn&rsquo;t support konqueror for some reason, and I badly need a browser having decent support for XSLT. Also, there is a comment below saying that Firefox is not stable on OS X 10.2.
