<div class="comment-content">
<p>I certainly agree Daniel&rsquo;s remark on Elearning alone, which is not just about the technology behind it, but rather, the intrinsic value that this platform, or shall I say, a revolution, can bring about.</p>
<p>There are just so many ways Elearning can actually penetrate into our lives ie Training simulations, virtual classrooms and etc.</p>
<p>Perhaps, what we all need right now is the right mental attitude and readiness to really fully appreciate Elearning.</p>
