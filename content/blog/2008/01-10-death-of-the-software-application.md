title: "Death of the software application"

[Carr](http://www.roughtype.com/index.php) made the headlines recently because he predicted the death of the IT department. Some time ago, [I wrote](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/11/21/having-scientific-meetings-with-brilliant-people-in-your-kitchen/):

> (&hellip;) institutions are no longer required to get the system running. No vice-president, no staff. It means you can run the world from your kitchen. Or at least, get some research done.


So, what is exciting about Carr&rsquo;s prediction?

I will now make a new prediction: the very concept of a software application will go away soon. Software will remain, but not as a countable quantity. What are software applications good for? When selling software, it is convenient to sell a unit of software. Software is increasingly a service, not a product. Software is fluid, fast-changing, and network-based. My prediction will become true because we will have a harder and harder time telling software applications apart. Instead of linking to applications, we will link to features or entry points.
