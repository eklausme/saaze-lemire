<p>Your seems related to a book I just started reading called &ldquo;The Cult of Statistical Significance.&rdquo; The authors say we should ask &ldquo;how much&rdquo; questions more often than &ldquo;whether&rdquo; questions. So I think they would agree that asking how sure you are that someone likes Celine Dion is not as important as asking how much they like her, or in terms of diversity, how much they like artists like her.</p>
