<p>Hello Daniel,</p>
<p>If I can add to your post, I think we all have the intuition that metadata *can* be useful. If there&rsquo;s no clear success so far, I like to believe that it is not because it is useless. </p>
<p>I think metadata will not improve significantly Yahoo &ldquo;ranking&rdquo; function for Web pages. However, there&rsquo;s clearly something at the level of &ldquo;query parsing&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Try typing &ldquo;montreal restaurant&rdquo; in Google. One of the first hit is a map. It means that Google understands that &ldquo;montreal&rdquo; is a location and &ldquo;restaurant&rdquo; is a business. It may look simple but Query Parsing is a nightmare! Ambiguity is everywhere and there&rsquo;s no context to leverage in a query. However, take a look at the series of patent by Google, Yahoo, Microsoft etc. about local search. It gives an idea of how they tackle problem.</p>
<p>In the case of this new initiative by Yahoo, I think the hope is to use similar techniques. And at some point, if someone type the query &ldquo;Product manager in San Francisco&rdquo;, Yahoo could put the LinkedIn profile of Amit Kumar in the hit list.</p>
