title: "Google has broken my roman numeral captcha"
---



Maverick Woo sent me an email to let me know that Google does [roman numeral arithmetic](https://www.google.com/search?q=VII%20plus%20X%20plus%20VIII&amp;gws_rd=ssl).

I can&rsquo;t help but imagine the discussion between between the Google engineer and his boss:

- (Engineer) Hi boss! I plan a new feature for our search engine&hellip; roman numeral arithmetic!
- (Harvard MBA) What a great idea! (Thinking to himself: I need to replace this guy.)


As a basis for comparison, it seems that Yahoo! does not have this feature.

Beside my blog&rsquo;s captcha, where else do you ever use roman numerals?
