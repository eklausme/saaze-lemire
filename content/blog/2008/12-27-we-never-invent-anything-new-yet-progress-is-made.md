title: "We never invent anything new, yet progress is made!"

Practical innovation [explains](/lemire/blog/2008/12/15/why-is-the-free-market-letting-us-down/) how per-capita wealth increased eightfold during the last century. Yet, we are constantly reminded that we never invent anything new:

- Most movies are remake or variations on older movies.
- Most research papers are variation on a theme.
- Most products and services are variations on existing products and services.


Even if I invent something recognized as <em>drastically novel</em>, I am sure someone will say &ldquo;oh! but we did that 20 years ago.&rdquo; A recent example are the [tag clouds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) which have no equivalent in my pre-Web textbooks. Yet, I am sure we can show that they are variation on much older visualization techniques.

If nothing really new is ever invented, why do we observe so much [innovation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Innovation)? As I watch the 1993-1993 [X-Files](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X_files) (season 1), I am amazed at how backward these FBI agents appear:

- They do not carry a cell phone and must run back to a land line to get help. (Update: toward the end of the season, we learn that Scully has a cell phone.)
- Even though agent Scully uses a DOS word processor (probably Word Perfect), all their archives are on paper or microfilms.
- While Scully has a modem, it is not clear that she uses any networked application. Agent Mulder does not use a computer? I found no sign of the Web.
- Files are not shared. For example, Mulder has his own files (the X-files) and apparently, others must come to him to have (paper) copies.


The key? Progress is incremental. Human beings are gregarious for a reason: our innovation process is social. Innovation occurs when new ideas are put into action by society.

For researchers wanting to create innovation, there are several implications:

- You can only be an effective researcher if you are an effective communicator.
- You should be connected as much as possible to the rest of society. It is not sufficient to impress the ivory tower: you must reach out.
