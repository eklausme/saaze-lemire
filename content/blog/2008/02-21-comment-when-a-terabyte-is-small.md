<p>I think this is one big obstacle for current research in IR. The time spent dealing with &ldquo;infrastructure&rdquo; is getting bigger. This leaves less time for real research. I think that, in the broad field of IR, &ldquo;industry research&rdquo; is going to produce much more results in the next years than &ldquo;academia research&rdquo;. </p>
<p>Google&rsquo;s Peter Norvig is quoted saying &#8211; Google does not have the best minds, they have a great infrastructure that allows them to experiment much faster.</p>
<p>How can academia deal with this?</p>

<p>LOL!!!<br/>
You are probably not old enough to know that rule:<br/>
No matter the size of the drive it is ALWAYS 95/98% full so for the &ldquo;next run&rdquo; (whatever this is) you have first to upgrade.<br/>
This is probably even more &ldquo;solid&rdquo; than Moore&rsquo;s law.<br/>
In the very early 70s a 5 <b>megabytes</b> drive was &ldquo;large&rdquo;&#8230;</p>
