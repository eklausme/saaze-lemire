Sufficient focus is necessary to be smart. The corollary is that distractions may turn your brain into mulch. There several conditions to sufficient focus:

- a sense of urgency: without a strong need to get the task done, long term focus is difficult;
- the dismissal of external stimuli: either you make sure not to be disturbed, or you can filter out the distractions;
- mental readiness: sometimes your mind will simply not focus before you rest.
