title: "Do you share and index your history?"
---



When you edit a document, some software will generate automatically a new version of the document and allow you to see what changed. If the software is sufficiently smart, you might even know when and by whom the change was made. [Wikipedia](https://www.wikipedia.org/) is good at keeping traces of everything. Email and blogs leave traces. Videoconferencing does not usually leave traces: you cannot replay a Skype conference after it has concluded.

However, beyond keeping traces, software can share and index traces. Each email is a trace of a conversation, and it can be retrieved later, but your emails are not shared. Word processors allow you to send a document with recorded changes, but you cannot easily refer to a specific change in the document.

In any case, I made the following table:
Medium                   |Keep history             |Share history            |Index history            |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
Word Processing          |Sometimes                |Manually                 |No                       |
Email                    |Yes                      |Manually                 |Yes                      |
Phone, Videoconferencing (Skype), face-to-face |No                       |No                       |No                       |
Facebook, Twitter        |Yes                      |Yes                      |No                       |
Blog                     |Yes                      |Yes                      |Yes                      |
