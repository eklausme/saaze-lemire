title: "Good research: invent new problems or explain mysteries"
---



It is a lot of work to grind through a research project and get an interesting paper out of it. Mostly, you have to be patient enough and work everyday at it. If you follow a sane process, it is difficult to fail entirely.

Picking the right research question is very important however: it is difficult to recover from a bad choice of topic. There are at least 3 types of good research questions: 1) explain with a theoretical model a (puzzling) experimental observation 2) improve by at least an order of magnitude an existing technique 3) make up a new problem and be the first to propose a solution (I call it Turney&rsquo;s way).

I now believe that options 1 and 3 are far better than option 2. To illustrate my opinion, here is a little scenario:

- read a paper;
- think to yourself: I could improve this idea ten times over;
- get excited, dream of fame, start crafting a paper;
- late on Friday night, realize your contribution is tiny;
- keep going (because you have invested so much);
- months later, publish a weak paper.


So I submit to you Lemire&rsquo;s first rule of good research: you must either be trying to explain puzzling experimental results, or be inventing new problems. In some sense, it amounts to discarding the &ldquo;engineering way&rdquo; which is to constantly perfect existing techniques.

__Further reader__: I have written much about how [I think one can write a good paper](/lemire/blog/rules-to-write-a-good-research-paper/) and about [my usual research process](/lemire/blog/2007/11/19/my-research-process/).
