title: "Even a tiny amount of beer makes you less productive?"
---



According to an article in the [New York Times](https://myaccount.nytimes.com/auth/login?URI=www-nc.nytimes.com/2008/03/18/science/18beer.html&amp;REFUSE_COOKIE_ERROR=SHOW_ERROR), drinking beer is correlated negatively with scientific productivity. What is surprising is that even small quantities of beer are correlated with decreases in productivity.

But correlation is not causality. They have not shown that drinking beer makes you less productive. They have shown that people drinking beer are less productive. (It is not the same!)
