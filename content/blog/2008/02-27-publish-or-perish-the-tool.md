Through Sebastien Paquet, I found a software application called [Publish or Perish](http://www.harzing.com/resources.htm#/pop.htm). It queries Google Scholar and computes statistics for you automagically. It works well. Linux and Windows version available. The Windows version runs under MacOS if you have [wine](https://www.winehq.org/).
