title: "When a terabyte is small"
---



With Kamel and Owen, I am working on a paper involving database indexes. We had over a terabyte of space, and yet, in the middle of the production of the paper, we ran out of space. __Only a year ago, I thought that one terabyte was large__.

So, I ask our technician about getting a new drive. He comes back with a small 500 GB drive. I ask how much they cost, he says &ldquo;$200.&rdquo;

This is a new frontier for me. Producing a simple research paper required us to generate more than one terabyte of data. Moreover, we will generate much more data before the paper is finished.

Assuming I write, say, 4 research papers a year, this means that I will generate over 4 terabytes of data a year at my current rate which is going to cost me about $1600 in storage.
