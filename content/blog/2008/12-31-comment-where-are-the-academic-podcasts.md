<p><i>But where are the researchers producing good podcasts?</i></p>
<p>I would imagine the researchers are doing research. If good podcasts take as much work as good lectures (and these take a whole lot of work), I&rsquo;m not sure how much time there would be left for doing research.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s never occurred to me to look for podcasts. I have listened to a few lectures online, usually on the recommendation of peers.</p>
<p>It strikes me that creating a good podcast is a lot of work. It is no work to let someone record a lecture, and it seems significantly easier to edit text or even slide presentations than to edit audio.</p>
<p>Is there any evidence that this work would be rewarded? I don&rsquo;t mean financially. Rather, is there an audience hungering for podcasts in general, let alone academic podcasts?</p>

<p>I suspect that many academics never liked lectures, just like you (and me). And not only because of rambling, but because of (recorded) spoken word is a fundamentally inferior form of delivery compared to written word. The main reason is that it is less interactive: you can&rsquo;t control the pacing, and it is much harder to jump to where you want. But it is also harder to understand: you don&rsquo;t have to deal with dialects and other idiosyncrasies in written text.</p>
<p>Non-recorded spoken word, i.e. a conversation, is on the other hand a good complement to written word.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m hoping to relaunch a personal podcast this month, although I can&rsquo;t say for sure how much content would be considered &lsquo;academic&rsquo;. I do plan on including excerpts from my lectures, but beyond that, no firm plans. I agree that more examples would be useful! ðŸ™‚</p>
