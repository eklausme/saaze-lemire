In gardening&mdash;as in research&mdash;there are 3 fundamental values one must cultivate.

- __Patience__. Quick results are possible without much effort. However, it takes a minimum of 3 years for a new garden to reach its maturity. The first year you set the ground, the second year you build-up, and the last year you reap your best results.
- __Persistence__. You have to continually work at your goals. You do not write great articles or great books the day before the deadline. You must watch over your plants every other day. If you go a week without visiting your garden, many of your fragile plants may die while the sturdy ones may grow out of control.
- __Perseverance__. You will fail. No matter what. You may have to change your plans drastically, but you should never give up. So, make sure you are having fun.
