I carry a pocketbook and a pen everywhere. At night, my pocketbook is by my bed. All creative workers should carry notebooks.

Organizing and collecting ideas are different tasks. My pocketbook is strictly for collection. Every few days,  I start a new page: a list of reminders on one side, and diagrams on the other side. Important ideas get processed and stored on my laptop. I throw away used pocketbooks.

It is difficult to find quality pocketbooks. Here are my recommendations:

- My pocketbook must last a few months. Paper must be thick and of good quality. I prefer unlined paper. I need a ribbon marker to quickly find the current page. [Paperblanks](http://www.paperblanks.com/location_support) make some good and inexpensive <em>Pocket Companions</em> fitting the bill. Alas, Paperblanks does not sell directly to customers. The retail info on the Paperblanks&rsquo; [web site](http://www.paperblanks.com/uk/en/) is helpful.
- I prefer black gel pens.  Rechargeable pens create less garbage and they are often of better quality. For about a year, I have had good luck with my Zebra gel pens.


__Note__: I do not profit in any way if you buy a Paperblanks pocketbook or Zebra pen.
