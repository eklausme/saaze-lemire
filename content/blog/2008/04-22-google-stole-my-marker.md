title: "Google stole my marker"
---



This year, I am the course coordinator for a Java course. One of our tutors went missing. Human resources tried to negotiate with him but he told them he did not care anymore.

I googled him. I got his resume, and then noticed that the top line says &ldquo;2008: now with Google.&rdquo;

I guess that must be a common phenomenon in hot spots like Stanford? It was a first for me.
