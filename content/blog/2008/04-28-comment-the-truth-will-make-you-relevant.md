<p>I agree completely. This fits well with my view that ethics is enlightened self-interest. In the long run, ethical science leads to better science, where &ldquo;better&rdquo; means more relevant, more fruitful, more accurate, more true. (That is, &ldquo;better&rdquo; is not merely a circular reference to &ldquo;more ethical&rdquo;.)</p>
<p>&ldquo;Ethical axioms are found and tested not very differently from the axioms of science. Truth is what stands the test of experience.&rdquo; √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù Albert Einstein</p>

<p><i>√¢‚Ç¨≈ìcrime√¢‚Ç¨¬ù sometimes pays. more than it should.</i></p>
<p>Unethical behaviour in general, and crime in particular, is like gambling at a casino. Sometimes you may win, but, in the long run, you will lose. More precisely, the statistically expected outcome is a loss. It is not rational to gamble when the odds are against you. Likewise, a fully enlightened person does not behave unethically.</p>
<p>This hypothesis has not yet been proven, but I believe that it will eventually be formalized in game theoretic terms and supported by empirical evidence. I find it to be a useful working hypothesis in my own life.</p>

<p>Being caught cheating certainly exacts a high penalty for those at the top&#8211;who are presumably more subject to scrutiny because of their exposure. I imagine that, for such people, it doesn&rsquo;t pay to cheat.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;d be curious to know if that holds true for everyone else, particularly when it comes to small cheats. I know a fairly senior researcher who had a reputation for putting his name on papers he barely read. He never achieved godlike status, but he has had a very successful career&#8211;quite possibly a more successful one than if he had not co-authored all of those publications. I imagine the same holds even more true for researchers grinding out least publishable units (LPUs) to obtain tenure at lesser-known institutions.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not a cynic; I do believe that the world ultimately rewards good behavior. But only in an amortized sense.</p>

<p>About <b>what</b> and for <b>whom</b>, cui bono?<br/>
I suspect that beyond the obviously working tit-for-tat and <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prisoner%27s_dilemma#The_iterated_prisoner.27s_dilemma" rel="nofollow">iterated prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma</a> policies the well meaning ethics are just a &ldquo;middle class&rdquo; illusion.<br/>
Genghiz Khan was quite successfull but not that much &ldquo;ethical&rdquo;, on the other extreme of the scale should the downtrodden stick to ethics they will be screwed up even more.</p>
