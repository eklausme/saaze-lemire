Andre [points us](http://synthese.wordpress.com/2008/01/10/pagerank-for-ranking-journals/) to [SciImago](http://www.scimagojr.com/) &mdash; a Web site to mine science journals. Using [their aggregates per country](http://www.scimagojr.com/countryrank.php?area=0&#038;category=0&#038;region=all&#038;year=all&#038;order=it&#038;min=0&#038;min_type=it) and [some data from Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Country_population), I made up a table on number of science papers produced per country going back to 1996.

What is fascinating is that the picture changes dramatically if you just look at the most recent year (2006):

These numbers suggest some significant changes:

- The US is still leading in the number of papers produced, but it no longer dominates. And it may not lead for many more decades if China keeps this up.
- Canada, Switzerland, Norway, Spain and Italy are improving their per capita numbers.
- Switzerland has a surprisingly high number of papers per capita.
- Japan has a surprisingly low number of papers per capita.
