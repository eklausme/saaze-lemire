<p>I&rsquo;m going to have to take exception to that last sentence. There are several reasons for this, but I&rsquo;ll focus on one: &ldquo;that&rsquo;s easy for a tenured professor to say&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I love research, but I&rsquo;m very much aware that my ability to do it during office hours could be taken away from me at the end of my current contract, just as I was aware that it could have be taken away from me at the end of my PhD studies. In order to prevent this dreaded outcome, I need recognition. The steps needed to get recognition are an annoying distraction from my research, something I dislike doing and aren&rsquo;t particularly good at. Thus, it is an immense frustration when it goes wrong, (and I have to focus more on it to get things back on track) and a big relief when it goes right (and I thus I can return my focus to actual research).</p>
<p>Furthermore, the recognition game is a bit more black-and-white than research. The rewards and frustrations of research tend &#8211; to me at least &#8211; to be more gradual and more gentle, whereas an acceptance or rejection comes all at once. Thus even if I mostly care about the science itself, it may be possible that the single highest high or lowest low comes from the recognition game.</p>
<p>Thus I have no shame in saying that my greatest frustration to date was the rejection of my first paper, and yet calling myself a bone fide researcher.</p>

<p>Another way to spin this is that the system turns you into a marketing drone. You need to focus on marketing to survive.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m still going to argue here, as I don&rsquo;t think its a binary distinction. Firstly, pedantically, it&rsquo;s not about survival. Not getting another contract at the end of my postdoc won&rsquo;t make me starve &#8211; if anything, it would do my earning potential a world of good.</p>
<p>Secondly, more importantly, what&rsquo;s the point of fighting to stay in the game if you have to lose the very reason for being there? This is where I take a bit of a stand: I do out-of-hours work when I am fired up with curiosity, and when I&rsquo;m stuck in the land of papers and PowerPoint I&rsquo;m desperate to get out of the door as soon as my contracted hours are over. I reckon that if I can&rsquo;t keep this attitude and still succeed, then a scientific career wasn&rsquo;t worth having anyway.</p>

<p>Maybe you got my post wrong. I did not argue that I was somehow pure, and that all of the rest of you were just marketing drones. I need to do some marketing otherwise, soon enough, they will cut my research grants and make it more difficult for more to pursue my interests.</p>
<p>When do you know that you have lost the war and become all fluff and no substance? When your work focuses on marketing. That&rsquo;s when!</p>
<p>It is a fine line.</p>

<p>OK, fair enough. I maintain my point about how day-to-day experience is a better measure than the highest highs and the lowest lows, but by and large we now seem to be agreeing.</p>

<p>To take the other extreme, very few of us would do research in a vacuum where we produced results that did not get published or presented. So we all must have *some* of the &ldquo;marketing bug&rdquo; (if you must call it that) in us.</p>

<p>Some amount of personal recognition is crucial not only to &ldquo;stay in the game,&rdquo; but also to provide outside validation of your work.</p>
<p>That said, I feel most vital as a researcher when I care only about the success of the research, and not about how or even whether I am personally recognized for it. Conversely, I feel most frustrated when I see the best and brightest researchers not focusing on what I believe to be the most important problems.</p>
<p>Perhaps this is just a more nuanced form of egotism.</p>
