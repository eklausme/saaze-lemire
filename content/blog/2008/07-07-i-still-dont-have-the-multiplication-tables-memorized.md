title: "I still donÂ´t have the multiplication tables memorized"

I read this [on slashdot](http://news.slashdot.org/story/08/07/07/153231/how-technology-changes-classrooms):

> I have a PhD in math, and I still don&rsquo;t have the multiplication tables memorized


Now I know I am not the only one!

In other news,

- I still deduce my age from my birth date (takes me a minute or so each time);
- I was identified as having a learning disability when I entered school (since I could not recite my phone number nor tie my shoes) and put in a special class;
- I still don&rsquo;t know my office phone number;
- I don&rsquo;t know my bank account number, nor how much money there is in it;
- I don&rsquo;t know my Social Insurance Number;
- I get the birthdays of my sons mixed up.


But I know what a [soliton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Soliton) is, I can solve nonlinear differential equations by multiscale methods, and I can [program my very own bitmap index](http://arxiv.org/abs/0805.3339) from scratch in C++. Oh! and I can grow coreopsis and echinacea from seeds.

Let us face it: the purpose of school should not be to teach specifics. And you should never judge kids by what you expect them to achieve. Let them surprise you!
