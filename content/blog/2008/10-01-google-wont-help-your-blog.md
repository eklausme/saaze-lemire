title: "Google wonÂ´t help your blog"
---



My blog has been [penalized in Google&rsquo;s index](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/09/04/my-blog-got-hacked/) for a few weeks now. While I would prefer that my content be easier to find, it does not worry me and my readership is not declining. Daniel Tunkelang [explains exactly why](http://thenoisychannel.com/?p=493): while Google brings a lot of traffic to my blog, almost none of it is relevant.

For example, my post on [Simpson&rsquo;s paradox](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/10/28/average-of-averages-is-not-the-average/) is the most popular page from Google&rsquo;s search engine. By far. Yet, it is not very exciting nor very representative. It gets a lot of traffic because many people want to compute the &ldquo;average of averages&rdquo;.

There is a practical conclusion: forget about most search-engine optimization tricks if you are a blogger. Making some of your pages show up first in Google will generally not increase your readership.
