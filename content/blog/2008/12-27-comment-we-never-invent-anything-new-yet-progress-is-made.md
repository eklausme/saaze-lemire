<p>I found your implications for researchers especially useful for those of us thinking about design-based research projects. It&rsquo;s too easy to just &ldquo;innovate&rdquo; in isolation and test with isolated groups. </p>
<p>But one of the purposes of design-based research is to create useful prototypes rather than impractical frameworks or ideas. Your two implications are useful and concise reminders of how to go about achieving this objective.</p>

<p>I agree with except on one point. Sometimes (rarely) a significant breakthrough is acheived by someone who really invent someting. Some examples :</p>
<p>&#8211; Copernic and geocentrism give up,<br/>
&#8211; Darwin and evolution theory,<br/>
&#8211; &#8230;</p>
<p>Sure that these breakthroughs have been possible by previous incremental progress. Citing Thomas Khun, science progress is discontinuous by nature. It is more rupture than accumulation.</p>

<p>The following sentence seems to be pretty much on the spot:<br/>
Even if I invent something recognized as drastically novel, I am sure someone will say â€œoh! but we did that 20 years ago.â€</p>
<p>I guess, novel ideas often present some known fact, in a new context.</p>
<p>I find some of your posts to be quite interesting.</p>
