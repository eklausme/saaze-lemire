<p>How do you balance studying giants&rsquo; ideas and applying your own ideas? When do you stop getting the state of the art and start your own work? I find it very difficult to balance these two things, and I usually get stuck reading papers / books for a long time.</p>

<p>Nice post! I think one of the most important prerequisites to solve a hard problem is having some sort of intense desire or interest in that problem. Without having a personal stake in the problem, without having the curiosity that would act as a fuel, it is harder. It should be used as a criteria to filter out problems. Those people who seem to start out with hard problems certainly have some intense interest in the problem! </p>
<p>For someone like me, trying to start in research, it is very easy to try those problems that are easy to understand but hard and famous. I wonder if that is a good approach, even if the advice you give is taken to heart and followed religiously. When, exactly in ones research career should one try a really hard problem?</p>
