title: "My spam filter is asocial"
---



I am deeply dissatisfied with Google Mail spam filter. I get 4 or 5 false positives per week, at least 2 of them are critical. It might be the best spam filter in the world, but it does not listen to me. It keeps on marking off as spam perfectly legitimate emails, written in French, from uqam.ca. I have no way to &ldquo;talk some sense into it.&rdquo; It is totally asocial.
