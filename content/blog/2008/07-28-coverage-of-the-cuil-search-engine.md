It seems that the Cuil search engine is getting reactions from almost everyone. On my blog roll, about ten people have commented on it.

Here is my verdict:

- Cuil.com claims to have outdone Google as far as recall goes: <em>Cuil searches more pages on the Web than anyone elseâ€”three times as many as Google and ten times as many as Microsoft</em>;
- It is not difficult to find queries for which Cuil returns nothing, or returns far fewer pages than Google does (See [what Daniel had to write about this](https://thenoisychannel.blogspot.com/2008/07/not-as-cuil-as-i-expected.html)). 


They also do some semantic analysis. For example, if you type my name, then it knows that I am a famous comedian (hint: I am not!), and helps you find other famous comedians. I think they made a mistake to tie the semantics to the query, and not to particular results. You can tell me more about a given Web page, that&rsquo;s useful. Guessing what my query meant? That&rsquo;s reckless.

So:

- Cuil needs more tuning,
- semantic analysis should not be so tied to the query terms,
- they do not appear to outdo Google in any significant way, and certainly not with respect to recall (but this may change).
