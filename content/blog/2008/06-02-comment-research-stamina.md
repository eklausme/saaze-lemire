<p>Professor, I am absolutely with you on maintaining a idea pool and working on them, probably each at a different stage in the &lsquo;processing pipeline&rsquo;. Infact, while developing software as I see it it&rsquo;s worthier to have a list of features to develop and a priority associated with each. Some times the higest priority task will be &lsquo;hello world&rsquo;. I just try deliver it I day ahead of time window, while stealing some time to work on a low priority /good to have/ or a long haul feature like refactoring the code base.</p>
