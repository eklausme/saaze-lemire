It looks like the government is [bailing us out](http://www.canada.com/montrealgazette/news/story.html?id=a48ebb65-23b9-438e-9910-b5a5e2ddf797). Wow! $400 millions. To put things in perspective, that is about 2000 times less than the recent bank bail-out in the USA. And I feel better about a university bail-out than a bank bail-out. But that&rsquo;s just me.
