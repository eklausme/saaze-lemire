title: "Programming with lego bricks and code completion"

[Erlang](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erlang_(programming_language)) is a fashionable programming language. The main benefit of Erlang is that it was designed with concurrency in mind. One high profile project based on Erlang was CouchDB. Well, [no longer](http://damienkatz.net/2008/04/couchdb_language_change.html). Damien switched to Java.

Yes. It is a joke.

Nevertheless, some of his remarks are interesting.
> Erlang lacks OO programming support, where the main focus is code reuse. Without OO you can&rsquo;t build software like Lego bricks, mixing and matching and swapping out the parts freely.


It is sometimes amazing how the Lego-brick analogy is popular among&hellip; people who have never done serious programming. In practice, __OO programming does little to help code reuse__.

> But the code completion in Java is so damn nice it really makes it easy to produce gobs of code quickly.


If the main problem you are facing as a programmer is to remember the name of the variables and the functions, __be worried__.
