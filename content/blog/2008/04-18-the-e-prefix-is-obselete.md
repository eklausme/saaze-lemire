Nicholas Carr asked whether IT departments mattered. What is IT all about? e-Collaboration, e-Mail, e-Learning, e-Health, e-Business, and so on. Does the &ldquo;e-&rdquo; matter?

I am working on a graduate program in e-collaboration. At<br/>
some point, I had to stop and think&hellip; isn&rsquo;t all collaboration<br/>
electronic? Even the construction workers use cell phones and PDAs.

Does anyone seriously sick fails to look their disease on Wikipedia, and enter related posting boards to meet other people who have the same disease?

Do you know any student who fail to use the Web to help them in their classes?

Do you know any business that is not also an e-Business? Even the shops at my local market have computers on their stands so that you can pay with a debit card.
