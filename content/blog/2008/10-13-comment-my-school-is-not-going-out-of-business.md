<p>Will they receive equity in the school that they can resell if you become highly profitable someday? And are there conditions against big parachute payments for the university president?</p>
<p>Seriously, I&rsquo;m glad your university will continue as a going concern. $400M might not seem so large compared to the big numbers in the headlines, but that is still quite a sum.</p>

<p>Given that it is a state university, there was never any question that the government had to take up the bill, somehow. </p>
<p>The really puzzling thing is that a state university managed to put itself in the red so much. Clearly, some people did not do their jobs. But you see, nobody was fired over this mess&#8230;</p>
<p>And this might be the real problem with bank bail-outs. What if, in ten years, the partially government-owned banks go out of business again? What then? Because the incompetent folks who mismanaged private money will surely mismanaged government money the same way, given time.</p>
<p>Clearly, we need to have a hard look at incentives for managers. Growth at all costs is not an option. Managers should carefully document their choices. They should lay out the risks at every step.</p>
