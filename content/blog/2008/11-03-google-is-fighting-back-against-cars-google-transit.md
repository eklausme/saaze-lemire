title: "Google is fighting back against cars: Google transit"
---



In North America, getting from point A to point B by foot or my bus can be quite difficult. Hence, many people prefer cars because, in some sense, they are easier. With cheap GPS devices, getting around in cars is really easy. Need to be somewhere at 6am? Your car will help you&hellip; What to use public transportation? Good luck.

Fortunately, Google is fighting back against cars! I tried [Google transit](https://transit.google.com). It helps you plan your trips using public transportation. What a brilliant tool!

Is there anything Google cannot do? I am really worried that they do too good a job. If I wanted to launch a Web start-up, I would hate to have to fear Google&hellip;
