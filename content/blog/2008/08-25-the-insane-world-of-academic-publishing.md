Stephen Few few wrote a [post](http://www.perceptualedge.com/blog/?p=264) on how insane academic publishing is. If you publish academic papers, his post is worth your time. Don&rsquo;t miss the comments!

Stephen is not in academia. From his point of view, what is required of him makes no sense:

- While he does not expect to get paid for publishing a paper, he expects some kind of symbolic reward like a few subscription to the journal: <em>Is there really any question that someone who takes the time to write an article and go through the lengthy process of working with a publisher, deserves a gesture of thanks equaling the cost of postage?</em>
- Stephen is surprised that reviewers remain anonymous through the entire process: <em>Cloaking the process in anonymity seemed to indicate a level of discomfort with critique that I didn&rsquo;t expect to find to this degree in academia.</em>
- He is upset with how IEEE handles copyright:&rdquo;<em>I have worked with several publishers and I have never had to give up my rights as author. Most modern publishers know that they don&rsquo;t need to strip authors of their rights in order to do their job.</em>&ldquo;


My own answers:

- Anonymous review is just a system we refuse to question. Speaking your mind is certainly a dangerous thing&mdash;more so in some countries than others. __However, I believe a scholar should have the backbone to speak out in the open. Do something else with your life if you are afraid to sign your opinion pieces.__
- The copyright issue is a shame. However, Stephen should also ask why so many employers ask for non-compete clauses. He should also ask why musicians sign away their soul routinely. I have always been puzzled at how easily TV series are killed: clearly the authors lose their copyright along the way. Fortunately, scholars are pretty bad at reading the contracts they sign&hellip;
