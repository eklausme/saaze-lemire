title: "Do researchers keep a plan?"
---



Shortly after I read [You and your research](http://www.chris-lott.org/), I decided to keep a roadmap. My current roadmap is a simple graph using less than 30 words &mdash; I use [Graphviz](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphviz). I list 4 recent papers, 3 ongoing projects and 7 upcoming projects. Each node of the graph is a project I can complete in a few months.

I update the upcoming projects on each Monday.

So far, it has some benefits:

- It helps me stay focused. Unless a new project fits in my plan, I discard it.
- It is easier to be ambitious with a roadmap over several years.
- (To be verified) On the long run, this routine should make grant applications easier and more fruitful. 


Some Ph.D. students have to submit such research plan, but do they keep them up-to-date? What about more mature researchers?

My guess is that few researchers (outside [Big Science](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Big_Science)) have up-to-date roadmaps. Let us face it: planning is hard, boring, and often useless.

If you are a researcher, do you have a plan?
