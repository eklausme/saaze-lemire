<p>If it is started from a commercial company, and the objective is to make money, I did not see the necessary causal link between a commercial model to a high quality journal, open or non-open. I think the open journal has to learn the model of open sources to build up the quality.</p>

<p>We recently got a warning about another bunch of new on-line journals who are apparently recruiting for their editorial board: Scientific Journals International.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t know if they are related, or more sign of a budding trend of open access journals with sometimes questionable standards.</p>

<p>To me, the number of OA journals launched by Bentham and their spam advertisement do no leave a good impression. Listing in Google and Google scholar is not of much relevance, one would need to check ISI (needed to get an impact factor) and Pubmed (MEDLINE). I have not bothered to check their 200+ journals but the few I checked are not listed anywhere. OA publishing is a way of earning money, too.<br/>
My favorite OA publisher is BMC with reputable journals, impact factor of several over 4 and quite some over 3.<br/>
Journals published by scientific societies are another excellent option (usually OA after 6 or 12 months).<br/>
