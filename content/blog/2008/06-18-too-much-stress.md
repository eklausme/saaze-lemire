title: "Too much stress"

I suffer from exhaustion. In the last few weeks, I had to resign from a few hats I wore. I resigned as union treasurer and I resigned as chair of the IT M.Sc. degree. Today, I stood up my friend Yuhong on a lunch date. Too much to do, too little time. I have reached a breaking point.
