<p>I use Moleskine as a notebook. Not cheap, but I was in love at first sight. ðŸ™‚<br/>

<p>I use a Moleskine like Preko. I hold onto them when they are used up, because sometimes it&rsquo;s fun to look back and see what a graphomaniac I can be. I also prefer graph paper lines since I tend to write at an angle without lined reminders. I use pencil, so I can erase misspellings, but if the mistake is anything other than a &ldquo;typo&rdquo;, I think the best practice is to just strike it out. Something learned from 10th grade chemistry I still actually use.</p>
<p>I have tried a number of online and digital tools for the same purpose as the notebook, but nothing can beat the convenience of it (even a PDA, back when those were in vogue). Maybe one day we&rsquo;ll have portable computers as easy to write on as pen and paper. I wonder if I&rsquo;ll switch.</p>
