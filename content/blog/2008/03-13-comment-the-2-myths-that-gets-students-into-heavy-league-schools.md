<p>Your comments seem to go a bit too far in the other direction.</p>
<p>Sure, professors mainly learn by reading papers and books. But I find it 10x more efficient to have a discussion with a colleague about their paper than to read their paper. At a good school, you will likely have more professors who are experts in their areas, and can do this explaining.</p>

<p>A PS: in computer science, at least, it does seem that quality goes down more quickly (as compared to, say, math) as one looks at lower ranked schools. (Disclaimer: I am talking <em>on average</em>, not in any individual case.)</p>
