title: "Proof that I am a stubborn bastard"
---



- I have not used Microsoft Office in over 5 years. I use Mac OS and Linux.
- I never use my employer&rsquo;s email service. Prior to Google Mail, I used a private provider and forwarded my work email there.
- I have never driven to work, in the last 4 years.
- As a researcher, I do not belong to any one community.
- I keep teaching an university-level XML course, even though I have been ridiculed for teaching such lowly technical issues.
