A very active feed that has remained in my list for a long time is a good feed (for me). My top 3 (in decreasing order of activity):

- [The Noisy Channel](http://thenoisychannel.com/): Daniel Tunkelang, chief Scientist at [Endeca](http://www.oracle.com/us/corporate/acquisitions/endeca/index.html). He works in information retrieval.
- Population of One: Sylvie NoÃ«l, research scientist at the government of Canada. She works in [HCI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Human-computer_interaction).
- [Ongoing](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/): Tim Bray, director of Web Technologies at Sun Microsystems. He helped create XML and Atom.
