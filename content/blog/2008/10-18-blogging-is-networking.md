title: "Blogging is networking"
---



Two years ago, I [asked](/lemire/blog/2006/04/06/academic-blogging-why-still-bother/) whether academic blogging was still relevant. At the time, two famous bloggers had stopped ([SÃ©bastien Paquet](http://www.blogsome.com/) and [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca)). Evidently, I kept on blogging. I even took up [microblogging](https://twitter.com/lemire).

Let me revisit some of the benefits.

- Bloggers are more visible. This blog has over 900 readers. Some are students, others are engineers, teachers, entrepreneurs, researchers or professors.
- Blogging is good for knowledge management: leaving a trace of your thoughts is always a good idea. You are also forced to flush out your ideas and you get immediate feedback.


However, reading [Daniel Tunkelang](http://thenoisychannel.com/2008/10/18/recent-sightings-of-citing/) today, I realized that the most important benefit is the networking effect. A blog without a social network is nothing. Nobody wants to read a list of random thoughts. What makes blogging rewarding for me are the comments and the link I receive. But I enjoy even more reading others and commenting elsewhere.

In effect, good blogging makes you part of a rich and open community. That is very valuable.
