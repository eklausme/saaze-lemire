In 2008, instead of losing weight or earning a larger salary, __work fewer hours and spend more time with your family and friends__. Longer hours, beyond a certain minimum, do not seem to increase intellectual production. 

> Contrary to popular belief, the amount of time spent studying or at work had no direct influence on academic performance.

Even if you do not care about your family, there is also a growing body of research showing that people working longer hours pollute more. Hence, by working long hours, you may pollute more, sacrifice your family, but not necessarily produce more.
