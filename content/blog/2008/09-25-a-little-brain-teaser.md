You are an explorer who arrived on planet Bypolar. The Bypolarians come in two species: the Falsians and the Truans. The Falsians always lie whereas the Truans always tell the truth. Alas, you do not know how to distinguish them.

In any case, two locals are waiting for you.

__First Bypolarian__: You are most welcome on our planet. You are safe here.

__Second Bypolarian__: You must leave at once. You are in danger.

__First Bypolarian__: Do not mind my friend, he always lie.

__Second Bypolarian__: Ah&hellip; we always disagree.

Should you be worried or relaxed?
