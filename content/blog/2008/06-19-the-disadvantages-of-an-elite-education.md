title: "The Disadvantages of an Elite Education"
---



I just read a great essay by [William Deresiewicz](http://english.yale.edu/), an associate professor of English at Yale. His message is clear: ivy-league education is flawed.

Here is the killer sentence:

> It&rsquo;s no coincidence that our current president [Bush], the apotheosis of entitled mediocrity, went to Yale.

__Disclosure__. I am a University of Toronto graduate. The closest thing Canada has to an Elite education, I would guess.
