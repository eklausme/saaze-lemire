<p>There is a basic contradiction in all the chatter going on about the &ldquo;Singularity&rdquo;, if it is truly to fit its definition <b>no predictions</b> can be made about its results.<br/>
Yet the afficionados like Kurzweil <a href="http://www.wired.com/2008/03/ff-kurzweil/?currentPage=all" rel="nofollow">keep blathering</a> about it.<br/>
It is much more likely than anything <i>exponential</i> within a <i>bounded</i> context will result in some sort of crash than in any &ldquo;transcendence&rdquo;.<br/>
And as it has been highlighted by Ross Ashby and Gordon Pask building up complexity requires <b>slowly</b> evolving parameters from the environment, thus any abrupt changes are likely to <b>destroy</b> complexity rather than enhance it.<br/>
Evolution took billions years for some reason&#8230;</p>
