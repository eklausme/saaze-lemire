<p>My PhD is in philosophy. My main interests were logic, philosophy of mind, and philosophy of science. I eventually left philosophy, mainly, I think, because I put more faith in experimentation than in argument. However, I enjoyed my study of philosophy, and there is much to recommend about it. I admire the audacity with which philosophers tackle apparently intractable problems. It makes other fields seem narrow-minded, mundane, cautious, and inhibited.</p>
