title: "Selecting emails per language"
---



Stephen Downes [asked why](https://twitter.com/Downes/statuses/988354050) he can&rsquo;t tell his computer that all emails in Russian are spam. Here is my answer.

__Part 1. Selecting emails per language__

As far as I know, this is not a documented feature, but [GMail](https://mail.google.com) allows you to select emails per <em>language</em>. Just type in the search box:

<code>language:french</code>

or

<code>language:chinese in:spam</code>

(I am aware the Chinese is not a language.)

You can also type &ldquo;lang:chinese&rdquo; if you prefer instead of &ldquo;language:chinese&rdquo;.

It has both false positives and false negatives. For example, I got an email with the subject line &ldquo;L&rsquo;internationalisation V.S. le SEO&rdquo; which is clearly in French&hellip; but GMail fails to recognize it as French.

__Part 2. Getting the spam filters to listen to your preferences__
