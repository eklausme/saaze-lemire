title: "Computer Science Research does not care about your System"
---



Jeff Dalton [reports](http://www.searchenginecaffe.com/2008/09/ten-myths-of-computer-science-research.html) on a presentation by [Dave Jensen](http://kdl.cs.umass.edu/people/jensen/) and [David Smith](http://ciir.cs.umass.edu/personnel/dasmith.html) on the Myths of Research in Computer Science. A key insight is that Computer Science Research is not about systems. Designing a better spam filter is a great idea, and might make you wealthy, but it is not what Computer Science is about.

I like the approach described by Jeff&rsquo;s post:

> Design an experiment to learn regardless of the outcome.


Of course, we all want to improve computations. However, you do not have to prove that your way is better than _their_ way (the macho approach). This sort of contest gets boring rather quickly.
