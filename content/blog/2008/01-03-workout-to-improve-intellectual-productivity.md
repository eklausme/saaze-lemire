title: "Workout to improve&#8230; intellectual productivity?"
---



As a student, I would jog regularly. It helped me cope with stress.

I gave up jogging, but I still often start my day by a long walk. It seems to be correlated with higher intellectual productivity. I see two possible explanations:

- Physical workout has a mood relaxing effect.
- As you workout, you outline your work and generate new ideas.


What do you think?
