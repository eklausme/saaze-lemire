title: "The art of paper review"
---



I do not claim to be an expert at reviewing academic papers, but I have done my share of work. Here is my recipe:

- __Reproducibility, (self-)plagiarism and presentation__ are easy to evaluate and I usually spend quite a bit of time on these issues. Science should be reproducible. ([Panos Ipeirotis seems to agree with me](http://www.behind-the-enemy-lines.com/2007/11/experimental-repeatability-or-simply.html).) Plagiarism can be surprisingly hard to detect, but it is also amazingly frequent, so I usually search for a few word cooccurrences in Google. Presentation is, on average, quite poor. Figures are often ugly. __Poor English__ is frequent.- The __relevance and strength__ of the paper is something I usually have an opinion about. Alas, it is easy to be wrong about the importance of a paper, so I usually do not have much to say unless I have directly worked on the same problems for a couple of years.- __Correctness is hard to check__ especially if I am not a domain expert. I usually pick up on secondary details. Are the results credible? Do the authors mention some special cases that should have arisen in their analysis or experiments? I must unfortunately admit that I usually cannot be sure that the papers I have reviewed are correct. At best, I can voice an opinion about their __credibility__.
