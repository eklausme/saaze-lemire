<p>But I do some of my best thinking in the shower! Not washing would be counterproductive.</p>

<p>Yes, I&rsquo;ve had entire papers conceived in the shower! My research productivity would soar if they put a private shower in my office, but somehow, the powers that be do not seem to understand my reasoning here.</p>

<p>I liked your post, but I don&rsquo;t agree with your statement that it is rude to ask a researcher for the implementation of a &ldquo;standard algorithm&rdquo;. If you have used such an algorithm in a previous paper and have a tried and tested implementation of it lying around, why shouldn&rsquo;t a graduate student (or anybody else for that matter) ask you for it? You are free to say no &#8211; although I would argue that to be counterproductive for you and the research community in general. And if you don&rsquo;t have an implementation then you simply state so. Where&rsquo;s the problem? </p>
<p>I guess my take is that most young researchers are relatively shy (me included) and don&rsquo;t send enough emails asking for advice/explanations/code/etc. I think emailing distinguished researchers should be encouraged not discouraged, and most researchers are indeed very happy to receive such requests. The lesson here, I suppose, is just to write a polite email if you want a polite answer.</p>

<p>Note to students: even if your question is in the &ldquo;OK&rdquo; category AND you get ans answer, don&rsquo;t hesitate to reply with a quick thank you. This is a good way to show appreciation and show us that you are not a creep who takes everything for granted.</p>
<p>I would tend to agree with placing standard/baseline algorithms in the &ldquo;not OK&rdquo; (although not flat-out &ldquo;rude&rdquo;) category. First if it&rsquo;s a good baseline, chances are there is a free implementation available somewhere. If you ask me about that, this is a good indication that you haven&rsquo;t done your homework.</p>
<p>Second, I would be reluctant to have my implementation of somebody else&rsquo;s work perceived somehow as a &ldquo;reference&rdquo; implementation.</p>
<p>I guess that the reaction you will get to your request depends in large part of the perception of how seriously you prepared that request. I would suggest the following rule of thumb : if you have put less effort in your request than you expect me to put in the reply: not OK.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,<br/>
Thanks for this artikel. I once in a while refer to it when answering emails of the type which you do consider not OK.</p>
