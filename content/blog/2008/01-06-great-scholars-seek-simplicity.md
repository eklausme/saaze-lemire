title: "Great scholars seek simplicity"
---



I just watched a talk by Bill Gates. His key insight is that complexity is what prevents us to solve problems. I would take this a step further. Extracting the simple, but important ideas should be the duty of any scholar. Unfortunately, we sometimes equate simplicity with triviality. Yet, smart people avoid complexity while getting the job done.
