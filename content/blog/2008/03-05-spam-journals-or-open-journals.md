A company called Bentham Open has launched a massive number of new journals in just about every field. Open journals are cool and can be of high quality as the [Journal of Machine Learning Research](http://jmlr.csail.mit.edu/) has shown. But what about Bentham?
They charge you $800 to publish a paper. That is an acceptable fee for researchers with grants.
