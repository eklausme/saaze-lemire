<p>I agree. For the past several months, my post about a dictionary-based Old English translator has gotten a healthy stream of visitors from Google who never visit any of my other posts and never leave comments.</p>

<p>Same thing with some links from big blogs. I have received a few links from big blogs that skyrocketed the traffic for 3-4 days. After the spike was gone, the number of subscribers remained pretty much the same. Long-term readership and short-term visitors are very very different. The most valuable links are those that come from other members of the &ldquo;community&rdquo; not from external, general audience blogs.</p>
