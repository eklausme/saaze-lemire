<p><i> the simpler approach is to accept that peer review isn&rsquo;t perfect?</i></p>
<p>Perfection is one thing. Biases are another.</p>
<p>I can live with a random variable that is not exactly 0. If I average enough of these variables, they will converge to zero. But what if they are not independent?</p>

<p>How would changing the composition of program committees every year cost anything? In some fields, you take the 3 most prestigious conferences and look at the program committees: you find that a third of the members are on all 3, or at least 2 program committees. Worse: you find this exact same composition every year (+/- 10%).</p>
<p>In some fields (I won&rsquo;t name them), you pick the 3 most prestigious journals and look at the board: you will find that 60% of the board members are on all 3 journals&#8230;</p>

<p><i> Has anyone done research on the problems you&rsquo;re describing anecdotally?</i> </p>
<p>We can observe entire fields becoming entirely focused on one tangent even if this one direction has not proven itself in the least. See for example, Lee Smolin, The Trouble With Physics.</p>
<p>As for the bias toward complexity, that&rsquo;s a personal observation, and I do not care to invest much time in proving it. I usually just take my papers elsewhere when I am unhappy with the peer review. Trying to prove objectively that the peer review was &ldquo;unfair to me&rdquo; appears to be a lot of work&#8230; for little potential gain&#8230; at least, at the individual level.</p>
<p><i> Re cost: I thought you were advocating the need for more reviewers per submission. Diversification is certainly a good idea in principle, but tell that to the journals that would have to forgo the top-shelf names on their boards.</i> </p>
<p>Ok. Maybe that was not such a great proposal.</p>
<p><i> I suppose the &ldquo;we&rdquo; in your post is the academic / research community. It seems to me that a more productive line of attack would start a bit smaller. Is there anything a single journal or department could do differently that would advance along the lines you&rsquo;re suggesting without making a significant sacrifice? Or is this one giant prisoner&rsquo;s dilemma?</i> </p>
<p>Certainly. I think numerous conferences have begun to worry about &ldquo;refreshing&rdquo; their program committees, or at least extending them. Other conferences (and no doubt, journals) have begun stressing reproducibility a lot more. Funding agencies worry more about open research than ever before. (More open usually means less of a barrier to entry, and thus more diversity.)</p>

<p>In what fields there really such a bias against simplicity? Mitz&rsquo;s anecdote not withstanding, I&rsquo;ve seen researchers do exactly the opposite, questioning what seem to be arbitrary choices made by an algorithm or heuristic.</p>
<p>Are you perhaps offering a complicated solution to a non-problem, where the simpler approach is to accept that peer review isn&rsquo;t perfect?</p>
<p>Not that I object to your recommendations, especially since I&rsquo;m not on the hook for funding them.</p>

<p>Points taken. And I don&rsquo;t doubt that cognitive bias infects the peer review process much as it infects all other decisions we make. But I am still hesitant to overgeneralize from Mitz&rsquo;s anecdote. Has anyone done research on the problems you&rsquo;re describing anecdotally? Or are you implicitly arguing that such research would never be published?</p>
