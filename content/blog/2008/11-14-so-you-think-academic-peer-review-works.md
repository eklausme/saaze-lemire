title: "So, you think academic peer review works?"
---



If you think peer review is sane, consider this example:

> El Naschie is editor in chief of the journal Chaos, Solitons and Fractals. This journal is published by Elsevier, one of the biggest players in the science publishing business. But here&rsquo;s where things get interesting: this journal also lists 322 papers with El Naschie as an author!



The journal has a high impact factor and a high rating by the Australian Academy of Sciences.
