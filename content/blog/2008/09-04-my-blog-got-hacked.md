title: "My blog got hacked"
---



Google just told me my blog is being taken out of their index. I investigated. Spammers took over my blog footer, inserting a large set of invisible hyperlinks. They did even worse: they created a large set of PHP files (hundreds!) that were serving spam from my blog without my knowledge.

I upgraded WordPress, changed my passwords, and I removed the offending files.

At least, Google was nice enough to warn me.
