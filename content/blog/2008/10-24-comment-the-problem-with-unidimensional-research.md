<p>I totally agree. My favorite papers always have something negative to say about their results.</p>
<p>I also like totally negative results. If something doesn&rsquo;t work like you expected based on your intuition, you can learn much more from that.</p>

<p>This is perhaps the best post I read on your blog. &ldquo;I believe this is the main reason why practitioners ignore researchers.&rdquo;. You nailed it straight on the head.</p>
<p>Is there any way to fix this situation? Medical researchers can&rsquo;t hide negative evidence. Students in all disciplines can be instructed to maintain academic honesty (e.g., to report all joint work on exercises) and they seem to follow. Is there a good way to encourage academic honesty in our community as well? Maybe to include a mandatory special section in referee reports, titled &ldquo;criticism/drawbacks of results&rdquo;?</p>

<p>Nice post. But I wonder if the problem is deeper&#8211;that it&rsquo;s not that researchers are hiding the negative evidence, but are oblivious to it. I&rsquo;ve seen information retrieval researchers who don&rsquo;t think of efficiency as an interesting metric, and therefore don&rsquo;t see a cost when their improvements lead to much higher computational expenses. And I suspect that many of those same researchers are also serving as reviewers.</p>
