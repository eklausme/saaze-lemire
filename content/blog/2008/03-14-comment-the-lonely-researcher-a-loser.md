<p>What&rsquo;s wrong with a mix of both?</p>
<p>I generally enjoy both the social and intellectual aspects of working with others. Most of my papers are in groups.</p>
<p>But at the same time I often like to have a project (or two) that I can work on on my own, without having to worry about others (who have their own timelines, priorities, etc. to deal with). And sometimes, random inspiration hits, and I find I have an unexpected (and sole author) paper.</p>
