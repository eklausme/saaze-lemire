title: "Who should be buying expensive commercial database systems?"

[According to Curt Monash](http://www.dbms2.com/2008/01/22/mid-range-database-management/), few people should be buying high-end Database management systems:

>There are relatively few applications that wouldn&rsquo;t run perfectly well on [PostgreSQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PostgreSQL) or [EnterpriseDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnterpriseDB) today. (&hellip;)

What&rsquo;s more, these mid-range database management systems can have significant advantages over their high-end brethren. The biggest is often price, for licenses and maintenance alike. Beyond that, they can be much easier to administer then their more complex counterparts. (&hellip;)

And what these mid-range [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBMS) don&rsquo;t do today, they likely will do soon. (&hellip;)

[EnterpriseDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EnterpriseDB) is equal or superior in every way I can think of to Oracle7, a few security certifications perhaps excepted.



If you work for an organization that has expensive contracts with Oracle or Microsoft for their [DBMS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DBMS), it is most certainly in vain.

Meanwhile, the world of open source Business Intelligence is getting more interesting every day. We now have [Pentaho Mondrian](/lemire/blog/2005/11/17/mondrian-to-partner-up-with-pentaho-for-open-source-business-intelligence/), Jedox, [Birt](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/), Enhydra Octopus, and so on. In 2005, [I asked whether open source was ready for Business Intelligence](/lemire/blog/2005/08/03/bi-is-ready-for-open-source-is-open-source-ready-for-bi/). The question seems less controversial in 2008, doesn&rsquo;t it?

Most of the database industry has been commoditized. If you stick around with these old schemas, [you lose](http://db.cs.berkeley.edu/jmh/talks/hpts2001-we-lose.pdf).
