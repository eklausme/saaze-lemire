<div class="comment-content">
<p>While reading your whole post, I could not help but exclaim &ldquo;exactly!&rdquo; out loud. I just deposited a 215 page thesis last Mondayâ€”on blogs actuallyâ€”which I&rsquo;ll defend next Tuesdayâ€”nothing like having it fresh in my mind. So I know what you are writing about first hand.</p>
<p>What really resonated was the line &ldquo;Feeling overwhelmed makes you stupid&rdquo;. There were moments during this process where I literally thought I wasn&rsquo;t competent enough to pull this off. Part of that is the self-doubt that most individuals who aren&rsquo;t megalomaniacs deal with when faced with a huge challenge. But mostly, it&rsquo;s because I was overwhelmed. I was looking for that major inspiration that would be the spine of my thesis. What I realized was that I needed to just deal with little bits and the spine would build itself, then I would readjust it.</p>
<p>What is interesting is that as someone who works in instructional design, I use this technique often as to not overwhelm learners &#8211; I&rsquo;m not sure if you are familiar with it but it&rsquo;s called chunking. The idea is to break down the content in bite sized pieces to reduce cognitive load and facilitate the learning process. </p>
<p>Thanks for sharing this. It helped to reflect on what I just went through.</p>
