title: "Canadian Computer Science professor fired for being into bondage"
---



Colin Wightman was recently fired from Acadia University. What wrong did he do? Mostly he had a one-time consensual [bondage](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bondage_(BDSM)) experience with a lady. They also accused him of using the university computers for some cybersex purposes.

The Canadian Association of University Teachers [found the dismissal grossly abusive](http://www.caut.ca/uploads/WightmanReport.pdf). They call for a [censure of Acadia University](http://www.caut.ca/aufa/newsletter/0508/investigation.htm) unless Wightman is rehired.

__Disclosure__: I was once a professor at Acadia University.
