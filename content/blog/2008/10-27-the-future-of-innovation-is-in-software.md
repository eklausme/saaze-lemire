title: "The future of innovation is in software"
---



I keep reading about how the future will be shaped by new cheaper fuel or amazing new medications. I believe that we are misreading the trends. Yes, we will have better medications and cheaper fuel in the future. However, I believe we are clearly in the mist of an [information revolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_revolution). The future will be shaped by software, defined broadly.

Specifically, I believe that:

- Tele-work, tele-play, tele-learning will soon represent 80% of our lives.
- There is much more room for innovation in software than in hardware. There are few ways to build a house, but many more ways to build a virtual house.
