<p>Interesting. I suspect your ideas about mistakes are true for just about anything.I have no intention of writing a thesis, but in my work it&rsquo;s good to remind myself that making a mistake is not the end of the world, and it probably won&rsquo;t have a lasting effect on my clients.It&rsquo;s not being humble&#8211; just realistic.</p>

<p>When I finished defending my thesis, one of the examiners said, &ldquo;The best theses will sit and collect dust.&rdquo; What he meant in the context of the conversation was that a good thesis is something no one will read, but should be something that spurs further research.</p>
<p>It may be that working on a branch isn&rsquo;t all that glamourous either. And if you happen to be working on a seed, you probably won&rsquo;t be around to see the branches it produces.</p>
