title: "A first draft of HTML 5&#8230; toward a new HTML?"
---



W3C just published today a first draft of [HTML 5](http://www.w3.org/TR/2008/WD-html5-20080122/). HTML 5 replaces HTML 4 and XHTML 1.
- They are getting rid of the &ldquo;acronym&rdquo; elements because it was rarely used.
- The elements &ldquo;canvas,&rdquo; &ldquo;video&rdquo;, &ldquo;audio&rdquo; are added: the HTML becomes fully multimedia. However, MathML and SVG remain embedded content.
- They added the &ldquo;article,&rdquo; &ldquo;section,&rdquo; and &ldquo;figure&rdquo; elements which should be useful to blogs and news sites.
