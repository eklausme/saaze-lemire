Up until now, it has been difficult for bosses to monitor employees remotely. A friend of ours worked from an office in downtown Montreal. She decided that working from home would be more efficient. Though her boss is conservative, he agreed. She must must be particularly happy this morning considering all the snow.

What happened? Her boss uses technology that monitors what she does. __These employee monitoring tools are more accurate and reliable than just passing by her desk to see what she is doing.__ All this data goes into databases and can be visualized and mined. Myself, I started using a [rescuetime](https://www.rescuetime.com/) and it has been an interesting experience. Did you know that I can spend 4 hours on email some days?

Employee monitoring will grow into a large industry.
