title: "Social Networking for Scientists: Mendeley"
---



Among scientists-bloggers, the new buzz word is [Mendeley](https://www.mendeley.com/): a social networking platform for scientists ([Ricardo Vidal](http://my.biotechlife.net/2008/08/13/mendeley-goes-public-and-gets-some-love-from-ex-skype-and-lastfm/), Sylvie NoÃ«l, [Misha Lemeshko](https://lemeshko.blogspot.com/2008/11/mendeley-some-suggestions.html), [Michael Kuhn](http://blog.mckuhn.de/2008/08/mendeley-mekentosj-papers-web-20.html), &hellip;). The site is barely getting started and is still in early beta, there are bugs and limitations. However, the London-based has funding and a solid staff.

Their vision statement is compelling:

> Mendeley is free __social__ __software__ for managing and sharing research papers. It is also a __Web 2.0 site__ for discovering research trends and connecting to like-minded academics. To achieve our long-term vision of a â€œ[Last.fm for research](http://blog.mendeley.com/academic-life/an-excellent-euroscience-adventure-part-ii/)â€œ, we&rsquo;re working with the former founding engineers of [Skype](https://www.skype.com/en/) and [Last.fm](http://www.last.fm/)&lsquo;s former chairman.


Last night I created a [profile](https://www.mendeley.com/profiles/daniel-lemire/). I got tired of entering my papers and I stopped entering them around 2005-2006. If you have 100 published papers, you are going to swear a lot. It is sad that you cannot just link to your existing pub. list (such as arxiv.org).

Where I see the potential is in the social networking. It seems that all of the scientific networking I do is &ldquo;hand-crafted&rdquo;. I am hoping for more!
