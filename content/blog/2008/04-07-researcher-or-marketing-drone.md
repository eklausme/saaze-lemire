title: "Researcher or marketing drone?"
---



In my [previous blog post](/lemire/blog/2008/04/05/the-need-to-do-great-things/), I defined research as the need to do great things. What I had in mind was quite broad, ranging from someone who does research to build a prettier garden, to the writer who does research for his next book, and including the artist who tries to come up with a new painting. I defined research as a need, and not an action. That is because __research is a state__. More precisely, it cannot be defined as a set of actions one willfully takes.
What is your greatest frustration about your work? What is your greatest victory? If they have to do with recognition, you are a marketing drone and not a bona fide researcher. Do not worry, there are many like you.
