<p>I was simultaneously fascinated and horrified by this account: and blame you Daniel for causing me to take 30 minutes reading the n-Category Cafe page on this! ðŸ˜‰</p>
<p>Why not disqualify editors from publishing in the journal? Like the model we have for judges: they are respected lawyers who are selected to judge. They cannot also be the counsel for the defence at the same time.</p>
<p>However, for academic publishing it would be less restrictive: whereas in most countries the judge does not practice law at all: in this case the editor can still publish in other journals.</p>
<p>It is the price to price to pay for being an editor.</p>
<p>Of course, for small specialized disciplines where there are few journals this might be problematic. Perhaps this could be fixed by having all peer-review of editor-submitted articles non-anonymous and published, thus putting greater onus on the reviewers. And maybe having more reviewers for this special case.</p>
