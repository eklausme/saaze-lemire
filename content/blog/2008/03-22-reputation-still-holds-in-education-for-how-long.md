title: "Reputation still holds in education&#8230; for how long?"
---



Readers of this blog who think that I am a bit mad would do well to go read the [latest Cringely](http://www.pbs.org/cringely/pulpit/2008/pulpit_20080321_004574.html):

> (&hellip;) reputation still holds in education, though its grip is weakening. (&hellip;) MIT threw videos of all its lecture courses &#8211; ALL its lecture courses &#8211; up on the web for anyone to watch for free. This was precisely comparable to SGI (remember them?) licensing OpenGL to Microsoft. What is it, then, that makes an MIT education worth $34,986? Is it the seminars that aren&rsquo;t on the web? Faculty guidance? Research experience? Getting drunk and falling in the Charles River without your pants?


Compare this quote with my posts [The 2 myths that gets students into ivy-league schools](/lemire/blog/2008/03/13/the-2-myths-that-gets-students-into-heavy-league-schools/), [Who needs your lectures?](/lemire/blog/2008/03/07/who-needs-your-lectures-anymore/), and [It may not matter all that much where you go to college](/lemire/blog/2007/09/05/it-may-not-matter-all-that-much-where-you-go-to-college/).

Yep. Not long ago people bought European electronics because it was supposedly better. Now? These days are long gone.
