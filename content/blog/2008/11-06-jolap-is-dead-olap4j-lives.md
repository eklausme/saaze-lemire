title: "JOLAP is dead, OLAP4J lives?"
---



There is an equivalent to SQL for multidimensional databases (OLAP) called [MDX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_Expressions). Alas, just like XML has DOM, OLAP would need a standard open API. The closest thing we ever got was JOLAP. However, I reported in 2005 that the [Java OLAP Interface (JOLAP) was dead](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2005/11/24/java-olap-interface-jolap-is-dead/).

[Julian Hyde](http://www.pentaho.com/team/julian_hyde.php) then proposed [olap4j](http://www.olap4j.org/). However, it seems that [adoption of olap4j is difficult](https://julianhyde.blogspot.com/2007/09/open-standards-and-open-source-ballad.html) even among open source Business Intelligence projects like [Eclipse BIRT](http://www.eclipse.org/birt/phoenix/).

Note: Yes, I am aware of the irony that my previous post was [DUAT: Do not use acronyms in titles](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/11/06/duat-do-not-use-acronyms-in-titles/).
