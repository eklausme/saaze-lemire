title: "Grabbing attention or building a reputation?"
---



Daniel Tunkelang has been writing on the [attention economy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_economy) ([here](http://thenoisychannel.com/2008/12/29/its-the-attention-stupid) and [here](http://thenoisychannel.com/2008/12/27/loic-le-meur-misses-the-point-of-twitter) for example): everyone is fighting to have your attention, and you only have so much to offer.

Attention is easy to measure:

- You can record the number of people subscribing to your blog.
- You can count the number of people citing your research papers.
- You can point to your number of followers on Twitter or your number of friends on Facebook.


However, I do not blog or write research papers merely to grab attention. Instead, __I seek to increase my reputation__. While attention fluctuates depending on your current actions, reputation builds up over time based on your reliability, your honesty, and your transparency. To build a good reputation, you do not need to do anything extraordinary: you just need to be consistent over a long time.

Of course, you need to get some attention if you are building a reputation. However, on the long run, the saying <em>build it and they will come</em>, is true. Being present and doing good work is enough. You do not need flashy presentations. Remain lean and mean. Avoid high maintenance operations. Do good quality work.
