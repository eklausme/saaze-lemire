__If you want to be smart, you must first learn to be free.__ Build low energy systems. Lean and mean machines.

To explain why freedom leads to better result, we had [Adam Smith](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam_Smith)&#8212;yes, I took economics once&#8212;who used a crude model to justify the use of free markets (an innovation at the time). But it takes time and patience to convince us that thriving for more freedom is necessary. Certainly, intelligence is fuzzier than we tend to believe.

Fear is freedom&rsquo;s worst enemy. Fear destroys freedom and ultimately, intelligence. In turn, this is why [leaderless organizations](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Starfish_And_the_Spider) are thriving. The leaders are not the trouble, the loss of freedom is.
