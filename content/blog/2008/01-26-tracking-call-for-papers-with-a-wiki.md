---



[WikiCFP](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/) is a tool to track call for papers collaboratively using a wiki. The call for papers are entered in [categories](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/allcat): you can follow only the [Machine Learning](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=machine%20learning), [Natural Language Processing](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=NLP), or [databases](http://www.wikicfp.com/cfp/call?conference=databases) call for papers. You can subscribe to [RSS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/RSS) feeds for each category.

What a good idea!
