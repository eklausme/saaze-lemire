title: "Who needs your lectures?"
---



You want a cool science lecture? You must register for a conference. Or take a class in a good university&hellip;

Or find a computer connected to this&hellip; Internet&hellip; they keep talking about.

VideoLectures is a site where you can find thousands of talks &mdash; mostly related to Computer Science. Here are some samples. Please try it. Please think about what this means for the future. Think about the value of the lectures you give week after week. What are you selling to your students? The chance to hear you talk? How much is it worth? How much will it be worth in a few years?
