title: "Staying organized without planning"

In a recent [post](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/10/13/cool-software-design-insight-6/), I told you to stop planning and start prototyping.
Cyril&#8212;whose web site you should visit just to admire his simple design&#8212;objected that efficiency maximization was a very personal matter.
I conclude that I must have misrepresented my idea. I seriously doubt that anyone can manage his time better than with a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm). In truth, I spend an hour every few days deciding on what I need to do next. What I never do is decide in October what I will do in February. I tried a few times and it never worked. Unless you are a cyborg, I doubt it can work for you.

Deciding on what to do next is not the same as planning. Or rather, my plans are crude:

1. do step A;
1. do step B;
1. (missing steps);
1. prove that N=NP (or achieve true AI).


I realized that trying to fill the blanks was useless. As long as I know what the next few steps are, I am in good shape. The trick is to constantly revise.
