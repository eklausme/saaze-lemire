title: "Blogs make meetings feel dull"
---



I have always hated meetings. I prefer to work alone at my desk, with the occasional email. I realized recently that blogging makes meetings feel even worse. 

There are many types of information you will not get through traditional channels. Peter Turney&rsquo;s latest post is one such example. He basically says that simplicity is just one type of bias: the simpler solution is not necessary better. Wow.

I am sure there are many people who are within meters of Peter right now, and they missed his post. They are probably busy preparing some management meeting. What a waste of time!

__If you have time for meetings, you do not spent enough time gossiping in the blogosphere.__

Do we need meetings? I just want to be left alone to reflect, write and read. If more of us did this, I am sure humanity would be collectively smarter.
