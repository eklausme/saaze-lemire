title: "Why is there no new Einstein?"
---



On my blog, the best content is in the comments. SÃ©bastien [reminded me of this fact](/lemire/blog/2008/03/04/what-are-conferences-good-for/#comments) today by offering a link to [an article in Physics Today by Lee Smolin](http://www.everythingimportant.org/relativity/no-new-einstein.pdf). The gist of the paper is that scientists feel a lot of pressure to follow the lead of powerful senior scientists. It is much easier to be productive when you follow established techniques. Any prospective Einstein is crushed by the system.
