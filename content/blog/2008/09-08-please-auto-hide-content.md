title: "Please auto-hide content"
---



Imagine if you came to my blog and it would load all unread articles. New readers would get a list of 1000+ posts. You would then need to hide each post, one by one.

It would be annoying, wouldn&rsquo;t it?

Likewise, I am seriously getting annoyed at email and RSS clients. I need a very simple function: if I have not read an email or a RSS post in x days, please take it off from my inbox. Move it into an auto-archive box.
I find it stressful to see all these emails waiting for me! Yes, I know about [Inbox Zero](http://www.43folders.com/2007/07/25/merlins-inbox-zero-talk), but I get so many emails that just archiving them manually takes too long!
