title: "Diversity in recommender systems: sketch of a bibliography"
---



I have been arguing [on this blog](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/12/22/collaborative-filtering-why-working-on-static-data-sets-is-not-enough/) that while everyone knows diversity is a desirable property of recommender systems, there has been little work on the topic. To make my claim precise, I decided to list the papers addressing both recommender systems and diversity. I mean this list to be complete.

- L. McGinty, B. Smyth, On the Role of Diversity in Conversational Recommender Systems, in: Proc. ICCBR 2003, 2003.
- Cai-Nicolas Ziegler, Sean M. McNee, Joseph A. Konstan, Georg Lausen, [Improving Recommendation Lists Through Topic Diversification](http://www2.informatik.uni-freiburg.de/~dbis/Publications/05/WWW05.html), <em>Proceedings of the 14th International World Wide Web Conference (WWW &rsquo;05),</em> May 10-14, 2005, Chiba, Japan. (Thanks to Daniel Haran for pointing me this one.)

WISE 2006, 2006.- S. M. McNee, J. Riedl, J. A. Konstan, [Being accurate is not enough: how accuracy  metrics have hurt recommender systems](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1125451.1125659), in: Proc. CHI &rsquo;06 (2006) 1097 â€“ 1101.

If I am missing any paper, tell me!

Maybe this warrants a Wikipedia page?
