<p><i>make up a new problem and be the first to propose a solution</i></p>
<p>You&rsquo;re giving away my secrets! Seriously, the world needs both inventors and refiners. Which you choose is probably more a personality thing than a strategic decision making thing.</p>

<p>Making up a new problem and being the first to propose a solution has two advantages: you&rsquo;re not trying to crack a nut that everyone else has been trying to crack for a long time, plus you have the biggest potential upside for novel contribution. The downside, however, is that you have a far bigger onus to prove that the new problem you&rsquo;ve made up is worthwhile, since you don&rsquo;t have the validation of others. I suspect it&rsquo;s generally harder to publish results about a problem no one else has heard of. A cynical reviewer&#8211;or simply a rationally skeptical one&#8211;might suspect you of having made up a problem because you are unable to solve any of the ones already on the table.</p>

<p>Coming up with good research problem which can sustain for ten years (in research community) is as difficult as solving a ten year old open problem. It&rsquo;s not *easy*.</p>
<p>Good research problems indeed means good research. Coming up with a new system is rather better and you get to solve the system in stages. But then you don&rsquo;t remain a theory guy.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s good to define a very big goal at the very beginning of your career and start solving all small problems towards that goal. In between you&rsquo;ll find some *very good* problems. Either solve it on your own or collaborate it.</p>

<p>at first when i read this i thought: yes, exactly! we need more (1) and (3) papers and fewer (2). but now i&rsquo;m not so sure. the issue for me is that a lot of times i feel like the process of going through the &ldquo;sludge&rdquo; of (2) is what eventually leads to (1)s and (3)s. in fact, (1)s would almost be impossible without lots of people (maybe not me!) working on many many minor (2)s. i feel it&rsquo;s also important for (3)s, too, because in order to do something new, you need to know what is possible already&#8230; at lot of times we have something that looks like a (2) only to find out a few years later that it actually has many qualities of a (3) that were simply lurking initially.</p>

<p><i>make up a new problem and be the first to propose a solution</i></p>
<p>I am rather attracted to this type of research, as well. However, having gone through the process a few time on a few (minor, but solid) research topics, I find that, because most of my initial work/effort is spent inventing a new problem, my initial proposed solutions are decent, but not great. When the new topic area finally catches on, it&rsquo;s because some (2) has looked at my (3), and easily made an order-of-magnitude improvement on it.</p>
<p>Thus, even though that (3) work was the first for a given area, the (2) work gets most of the perceptual credit.</p>
<p>So I still believe that being able to open up new (3) areas is a very important research skill. But aside from personal satisfaction, isn&rsquo;t it rather dangerous to be a &ldquo;first mover&rdquo;? Isn&rsquo;t history replete with examples of the &ldquo;second mover&rdquo; getting most of the credit?</p>

<p>I think there is a connection between your ideas and Kuhn&rsquo;s concepts of &ldquo;normal science&rdquo; and &ldquo;revolutionary science&rdquo;. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions#Coherence" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Structure_of_Scientific_Revolutions#Coherence</a></p>
<p>I think Peter is right, these kinds of work correspond to different personality types. From an impact standpoint, the mistake you don&rsquo;t want to make is to do refinement work when the field is on the verge of a revolution. But I suppose that can be hard to guess.</p>
