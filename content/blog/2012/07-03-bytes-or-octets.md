Quick: what is the definition of a _byte_ (as in <em>two kilobytes</em>)?

If you said it is a unit of 8 bits, you failed.

Correct answer (according to [IEEE 1541](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/IEEE_1541)):

- A byte is a set of adjacent bits operated on as a group;
- The octet is a set of 8&nbsp;bits.


Hence, if I refer to 1024 times 8 bits, I should avoid &ldquo;1&thinsp;kB&rdquo; as this can be interpreted as 1000&thinsp;bytes where byte is a platform-specific term. I should write 1&thinsp;Kio or <em>one kibioctet</em>.

__Note__: Yes, I am being pedantic.

__Note 2__: I initially wrote &ldquo;1&thinsp;KB&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;1&thinsp;kB&rdquo;.
