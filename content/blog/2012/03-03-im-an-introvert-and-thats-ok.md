title: "I´m an introvert. And that´s ok."
---



I&rsquo;m an [introvert](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introvert). That&rsquo;s why you don&rsquo;t see me at meetings and celebrations. If you do, I&rsquo;m in a corner looking awkward. That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m not trying to build a large laboratory of busy graduate students. That&rsquo;s why I crave time alone to reflect and think, to write and code&hellip;

I am not <em>shy</em>: I can talk in front of 200 people without thinking twice about it. I don&rsquo;t lack confidence. I have a large ego&mdash;too large some would say. (I got my wife to read this post and she particularly agrees with this last sentence.)

But my social interactions have high transaction cost: it takes me time and energy just to start chatting with someone. If I have to chat with dozens of people in a day, I end up exhausted. I can&rsquo;t pretend to be your friend on the fly. My brain does not work that way.

I love how it is progressively becoming &ldquo;ok&rdquo; to be an introvert:

- Carl King wrote a beautiful [essay](http://www.carlkingdom.com/10-myths-about-introverts): 10 Myths About Introverts. The last myth is the most important: &ldquo;Introverts can fix themselves and become Extroverts&rdquo;. Gays cannot become straight. Blacks cannot become white. I cannot become an extrovert. King&rsquo;s essay impressed me so much that I bought his book [So, You&rsquo;re A Creative Genius](https://www.amazon.com/Youre-Creative-Genius-Now-What/dp/1932907920/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1330815993&#038;sr=8-1): a great read if you are both a creative person and an introvert.
- Susan Cain gave a great talk based on her book: [Quiet&mdash;The Power of Introverts in a World That Can&rsquo;t Stop Talking](https://www.amazon.com/Quiet-Power-Introverts-World-Talking/dp/0307352145/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&#038;ie=UTF8&#038;qid=1330816086&#038;sr=1-1). A core message of her talk is that we should recognize our bias against introverts. Not everyone works best in groups. And that&rsquo;s ok. Schools and employers need to stop their attempts to fit introverts in the extrovert mold.
