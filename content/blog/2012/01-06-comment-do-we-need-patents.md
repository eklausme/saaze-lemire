<p>I agree with the point. It is very interesting argument indeed.<br/>
I would be interested to know if there is at least one good use of patents to help innovation and human progress.<br/>
Copyright protection is somewhat similar but doesn&rsquo;t have such a negative effect.</p>

<p>Very true. With phrama patents, I&rsquo;d at least like to see an experiment of research grants that fund clinical trials in exchange for abandoning the ability to patent the results. If it leads to a few successful results, it would put pressure on our system of funding clinical trials with a government granted monopoly rather than funding them directly.</p>

<p>Did industry in Switzerland, Germany, Italy, etc, have other means of protecting their products &#8212; trade secrets, lack of need to disclose targets or relavent compounds, etc &#8212; prior to introduction of patents in &rsquo;67-&rsquo;77?</p>

<p>Yes, most countries recognized trade secrets and process patents prior to 1967-1977. The USA and UK offered much stronger protections however. </p>
<p>If regulations were helpful, countries where inventions were more heavily regulated should have been more prosperous. It wasn&rsquo;t the case.</p>

<p>See Derek Loweâ€™s post for an opposing view point. He has worked for over 30 years in the pharma industry:</p>

<p>I do think weakening patent protection substantially will lead to more trade secrets like it has in the self-driving car industry and possibly push driven people to work in societally less useful fields like finance / high frequency trading.</p>

<p>The United States Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO) has an intresting paper on this:</p>
<blockquote><p>
We find that rising piracy increases subsequent R&amp;D spending [&#8230;] for large, incumbent software firms. [&#8230;] We conclude that piracy and similar competitive shocks push firms to innovate to stay ahead of imitator products
</p></blockquote>

<p>So basically the USPTO came to the conclusion that patents are a bad thing for innovation and more competition increases innovation. Who would have thought that is possible? ðŸ˜€</p>
