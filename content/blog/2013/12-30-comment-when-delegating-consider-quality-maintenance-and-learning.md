<p>An important lesson I&rsquo;ve started learning as a manager is that those 3 considerations are also reasons to delegate work. I could often fix a bug in code I know intimately 20x faster than a new hire. But that ignores the opportunity for them to learn about the codebase. Or the question of maintainability should I leave. Or the value in learning about the new hire: where exactly do their strengths and weaknesses as a programmer lie. It&rsquo;s interesting that the prompt &lsquo;consider quality, maintenance and learning&rsquo; is simultaneously caution about overdelegating and underdelegating.</p>

<p>Good point. </p>
<p>For example, I do delegate to graduate students, even when I could do it much faster myself, precisely because they need to learn. </p>
<p>But I think many people delegate without considering (before it is too late) that by delegating they miss an opportunity to learn.</p>
<p>It is not uncommon for managers to lose competence.</p>
