title: "Who plays nice? Who plays rough?"

I have a confession to make. I am one of these people who can&rsquo;t watch a TV show like [Game of thrones](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Game_of_Thrones) because there is too much evil. In fact, I generally cringe when reading novels or watching movies where there is too much lying or backstabbing. I simply cannot stand it.

In academia, there are versions of <em>Game of thrones</em> unfolding at times. I similarly despise them.

I would have been very unhappy as an employee of the NSA.

I don&rsquo;t know how common this is&hellip; but I have hard time watching a movie like Harry Potter. It doesn&rsquo;t mean that I am all soft and cuddly. In fact, maybe the opposite is true: I have very little tolerance for people who backstab or denigrate others. I will go out of my way to avoid them.

So how would I fare in a &ldquo;ruthless business&rdquo;?

Maybe better than I thought:

> (&hellip;) we compare students with two adult populations deliberately selected from two cutthroat internet industries &mdash; domain trading and adult entertainment (pornography). Across a range of indicators, business people in these industries are more pro-social than students: they are more altruistic, trusting, trustworthy, and lying averse. ([Hoffman and Morgan, 2013](http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2345102))


It is easy to assume that &ldquo;nice folks&rdquo; will thrive in a highly regulated setting (e.g., in a government job, in academia) whereas &ldquo;ruthless folks&rdquo; will do better in a cutthroat industry. But the reverse might be true.

In a less regulated setting, your career depends on the collaboration of strangers. If you have a high tolerance for cheating and lying, your reputation might suffer, or you might not be so easily turned off by other cheaters. Both of these effects will harm you.

In a more formal social setting, ruthless individuals may fare better: being &ldquo;morally flexible&rdquo; is more likely to get you ahead.
