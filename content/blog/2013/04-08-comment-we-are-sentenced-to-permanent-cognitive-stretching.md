<p>Nice post!</p>
<p>I am personally affected by the opposite problem. I am conscious of not knowing many things, especially in fields adjacent to mine (parallel computing, numerical analysis, statistics, linguistics) and I suffer the fact that my happiness, induced by the learning activity, is demolished by the Internet. For each super-clever thing I arrive to, a random search in StackOverflow, for example, will show me how insignificant it actually was.</p>
<p>I suffer the fact that in the Internet is very difficult to achieve the full appreciation of your own achievements.</p>
<p>Am I weird?</p>
