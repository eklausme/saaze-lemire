<p>I completely agree with your idea of engaging reviewers in a dialog. There&rsquo;s a lot of mis-understandings that happen with blind reviews and I would often have preferred transparency both as a submitter and as a reviewer.</p>
<p>But I&rsquo;m a little worried by your proposal &#8211; if it takes off. Suppose everyone did this, including Peter Norvig. Now, say I have this cool idea for fast integer decoding &#8211; who am I going to send it first: Norvig or Lemire? A simple game theoretical analysis says Norvig, even though Lemire is clearly the better choice. Why? Because Norvig might get me a high-paying job with a cool company and has thousands more Twitter followers than Lemire. </p>
<p>I think that keeping the function that journal editors play as &ldquo;switchboards&rdquo; for peer-matchups might still be better than &ldquo;send me your draft, and I&rsquo;ll advertise your paper if you revise it to my satisfaction.&rdquo; We just need to change how journals work.</p>

<p>I see a business opportunity: an &ldquo;E-harmony&rdquo; for matching authors and reviewers. A technology development opportunity for a better kind of recommender too &#8211; reviewers could be &ldquo;rated&rdquo; and recommended across different dimensions (subject matter knowledge / detail of reviews / helpfulness). Authors could be rated according to how finished their submissions are (I hate it when I get a poorly written submission with mistakes everywhere in order to get free proof-reading)&#8230;.</p>

<p>In the future I imagine, you&rsquo;d seek a reviewer for your latest manuscript, maybe using some kind of computer-assisted process. You&rsquo;d obviously want your reviewers to be as well known and as influential as possible. But this is actually a good thing! </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t imagine this would replace journals. It is more about going beyond journals.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s like saying &ldquo;YouTube won&rsquo;t replace TV channels&rdquo;. No, it won&rsquo;t.</p>

<p>By the way, though I can only guess, I suspect that Norvig might be open to something like I describe. Google has not focused its research on journals and conferences.</p>

<p>Could it be built upon <a href="http://arxaliv.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://arxaliv.org/</a> ?</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s already there and it&rsquo;s open source.</p>
<p>In my opinion we would (at the very least) need to (1) differentiate (i.e. givign different weigths) between pseudonym and &ldquo;real name&rdquo; users and (2) differentiate between pure up/downvote and actual reviews/comments.</p>

<p>Yes I am very much interested in this.<br/>
Open reviews. Reviews of reviewers. Some closed reviews if really needed. Repositories/versioning for papers.<br/>
At the end only citations really count. Reviewers can help a paper get better IF there is no competition. Ideally&#8230; but we all know this is not true.<br/>
So better leave it to the judgement of the masses. Crowdsource reviews and comments.<br/>
At the end only the number of citations and impact of the paper really count.</p>
<p>I wrote about this also here:<br/>
