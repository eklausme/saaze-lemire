<p>Daylight Saving Time is one of those things that has never been convincingly explained in any of the near forty years I&rsquo;ve been alive. No one I&rsquo;ve met likes it, yet it&rsquo;s something everyone goes along with because &ldquo;that&rsquo;s the way we&rsquo;ve always done it&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Speaking as someone who has to manipulate time with a computer, I can tell you that I would gladly welcome the demise of DST.</p>

<p>The GMT/BST debate always strikes me as a completely false spectacle. It is the unthinking obedience to &ldquo;Captain Clock&rdquo; that should be called into question.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t like dark mornings, why not show up later at work?</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Scientific evidence shows that teenagers learn better from 11am also? So why does school start at nine?</p>
<p>Ah!</p>
<p>Because the point is not the time, or the amount of daylight, but that you learn to OBEY! The clocks going forward and back twice a year really is a &ldquo;Jump? Yessir! How high?&rdquo; phenomenon.</p>
<p>Anyone with insufficient autonomy to reject social time and live their life at a chosen latitude according to the astronomical time prevailing there is bound to be somewhat oppressed and therefore somewhat depressed.</p>

<p>What about adjusting our watches twice a year? ðŸ˜‰ This is annoying too!</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve lived in Arizona for five years now and I hate not changing the clocks. The problem is work schedules don&rsquo;t change but the time my body wants to get out of bed varies greatly throughout the year. I realize days are shorter in the winter but it&rsquo;s mitigated somewhat by changing the clock. But in Arizona my body wants to get out of bed at 4:30 in July and 8:30 in December.</p>

<p>I am a U.S. newcomer from China, and I&rsquo;ve felt a little bit tired since the start of this DST. I think it is partially because I have to adjust my biological clock an hour earlier, which seems to be bad for health. China only has one time zone and has never widely adopted DST policy, although it is well known for our farm products.</p>
<p>Btw, such petition to the White House is a time-wasting effort if understanding the concept of Separation of Powers under the United States Constitution.</p>
