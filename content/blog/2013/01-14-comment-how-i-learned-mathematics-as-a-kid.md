<p>I am undoubtedly much older than you are. When I was a small child I knew that my phone number was 54J. That is so small I couldn&rsquo;t help learning it.</p>
<p>Your description of how you got turned on to math sounds like that of many mathematicians I know. The ingredients vary. I think I am less contrarian than you (probably to my detriment) and I did have one high school teacher who actually got me interested in solid geometry. Some mathematicians I know (not me) grew up in families that were interested in math and shared their interest. But what is in common with most of us a self-directed nature that makes us do what we want to do and not what people expect us to do, which is one aspect of being nerdy.</p>

<p>I have a very similar story to tell about my experience with math. The details of my story are slightly different, but the broad picture is almost identical.</p>

<p>Speaking of math education there&rsquo;s some kind of minor revolution going on at Finland and <a href="http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/09/estonia-reprograms-first-graders-as-web-coders/" rel="nofollow">Estonia</a>. Teachers have been producing Creative Commons (BY-SA) licensed material. That could be a game changer or at least challenge the status quo.</p>
<p>You can find more information about the Finnish development at <a href="http://avoinoppikirja.fi/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://avoinoppikirja.fi/</a> (Google Translate seems ok).</p>
<p>I think these sort of moves are necessary for us to keep up with the progress. You definitely don&rsquo;t want to fall behind as a nation when it comes to things like these.</p>

<p>Do not rule out the possibility that you were contrarian by nature. My daughter certainly is &#8211; she is nearly 4 now, but I know for certain she was contrarian as early as she had language. She constantly experiments with consequences, and tests our assertions.</p>

<p>For better or worse, I think there are natural factors that cause more or less contrariness. After all, there is a psychiatric disorder something like &ldquo;oppositional defiant disorder&rdquo;. Like most such things, it will probably turn out that this condition is a broad spectrum rather than an on-off switch.</p>
<p>I consider myself something of a &ldquo;disruptor&rdquo; rather than a contrarian (my wife might have a different view).</p>

<p>So there might be a contrarian gene?</p>

<p>Hi, I too learned math by playing monopoly. At some points I was tired of loosing everytime against so I went to the &ldquo;bibliobus&rdquo; (a mobile library we used to have in my birth town) and borrowed &ldquo;Comment gagner au monopoly&rdquo; (how to win at Monopoly) and then a discovery: the most frequent score you can do with two 6 dices is 7 (6+1, 5+2, ..) and so I started to try to learn basic probabilities (of course I failed but still, I started to win a bit more often)..</p>
<p>Good memory, thanks Daniel for that post ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>Unfortunately, my 9-year-old daughter is not very contrarian: she doesn&rsquo;t object to busywork or mind that math in school is mainly easy stuff she already knows. Fortunately, she was apparently born with an interest in math &#8212; and she has her own Professor Calculus, in the form of Dick Feynman. I recently started reading her Feynman&rsquo;s entertaining memoirs as her bedtime story. Whenever he mentions a math concept she wants to know all about it. First trigonometry, then e, now homotopy groups. So I try to give her a sense of the mathematical objects even though they&rsquo;re far ahead of what she &ldquo;ought&rdquo; to be learning next. One question leads to another and we end up working back to more fundamental concepts. This curiosity-driven style of instruction might not work for all kids, or all parents, but she eats it up. It&rsquo;s not very different from the way I teach grad students in my office: if they are missing some piece of math we need for a problem, I explain it on demand, working back as far as necessary. They are engaged because they need it RIGHT THEN. I am not sure whether this model of instruction can be scaled to larger classes.</p>

<p>Well that is awesome, My dad was a teacher (and according to his students a good one), but he was always so tough on us that we did not want his help at all.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think being contrarian is entirely useful &#8211; in fact for some people it causes more trouble than good &#8211; Ashley Smith is an example. I am not contrarian in terms of tasks I will do, I just question arguments or beliefs.</p>
<p>I do see that contrarianism in a select few would be a darwinistic advantage for the species as a whole.</p>
