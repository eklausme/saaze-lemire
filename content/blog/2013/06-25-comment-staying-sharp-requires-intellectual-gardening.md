<p>Given the state of my backyard, likely I should be wary of gardening analogies.</p>
<p>In a similar vein, I find that my expertise tends to be episodic. I learned SQL and relational database usage quite well back in the mid-80s, yet there are times when I do no work in that area for years. The same can be said for GUI, Java, Perl or C++ programming, at one time or another. Starting a new episode requires much use of reference materials, at first, but the once-familiar topic comes back quickly.</p>
<p>Maybe gardening is a good analogy, as something once very familiar, if currently disused. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>To be effective, you have to let at least some disused skills rust, to allow focus on used skills.</p>

<p>I had the opportunity to work with a real c++ guru a while back. His code had approachability issues (you had to be at least familiar with everything C++ has to offer), but once you got past that his solutions were invariably straightforward, generalizable and robust. He could make that language dance.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m at another extreme, with endless interests. I&rsquo;m never able to focus long enough on a single topic to reach the very top echelons of it. But that wide breadth of knowledge has served me well. I can program. I can write. I can do complicated math. I can pull inspiration from nature, from the mind, from quantum physics, from whatever. I find I can approach arbitrary problems for more directions than most.</p>
<p>Ultimately, the world needs gardens devoted to a few of the best flowers, wide overflowing, haphazardly cultivated gardens and everything in between.</p>
