title: "Is learning useless stuff good for you?"
---



We often require all students to learn things they may never need like latin, calculus, advanced trigonometry and classical literature. The implicit assumption is that learning difficult things is intrinsically good. It trains your brain. It makes you smarter.

True? Or false?

I worked on this assumption for the longest time. As an undergraduate, I took 6 courses per term instead of the required 5. I also took an extra year to graduate, doing the equivalent two majors. I probably took more college courses than 99.9% of the college graduates.

Why did I take all these courses? Because I was convinced that learning about all sorts of things would make me smarter. Many people think it works this way. That&rsquo;s why we taught people Latin for a long time. In education, that is called <em>transfer</em>: learning something will help you learn something else, even if it is barely related. Does it work? We have reasons to doubt it:

> Transfer has been studied since the turn of the XXth century. Still, there is very little empirical evidence showing meaningful transfer to occur and much less evidence showing it under experimental control. (&hellip;) significant transfer is probably rare and accounts for very little human behavior. ([Detterman](http://www.citeulike.org/user/rebeccamancy/article/2698279))


[Caplan](http://econlog.econlib.org/archives/2012/08/low_transfer_of.html) is even more categorical:

> Teachers like to think that no matter how useless their lessons appear, they are teaching their students how to think. Under the heading of Transfer of Learning, educational psychologists have spent over a century looking for evidence that this sort of learning actually occurs. The results are decidedly negative.

These authors are not saying that learning French won&rsquo;t help you learn Spanish. They are not saying that learning C++ won&rsquo;t help you learn Java. Transfer does work, trivially, when there are similarities. Rather, they are saying that learning projective geometry won&rsquo;t make you a better Java programmer. They are saying that learning fractal theory won&rsquo;t help you be a better manager.

This has troubling consequences because, for many people, whatever they learned in college or in high school, has very little to do with what they do for a living. Does a degree in journalism makes you a better program manager today? You can legitimately ask the question. Yet employers are happy to assume that a degree, any degree, will help people do a better job, irrespective of the similarities between the job and the degree. For example, Tom Chi [explains](https://vimeo.com/46316512#) how his training in astrophysics made him a better business manager. From astrophysics to management? Really?

Can we at least hope that college students improve their critical thinking with all these literature, mathematics and philosophy classes? [Roksaa and Arumb](http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/00091383.2011.556992) looked at the score of students on critical thinking tests as they progress through their studies:

> A high proportion of students are progressing through higher education today without measurable gains in critical thinking.



The students have learned skills. It is difficult to go through years of studies without learning something. But this knowledge and these skills do not necessarily transfer to something as basic as critical thinking.

My point is that students might be onto something when they refuse to learn for the sake of learning. We look down at people who refuse to learn mathematics because it appears useless to them. We think that learning some mathematics would be good for them the same way we used to think that learning latin was good for the minds of little boys. We might be wrong.

But this has also a practical consequence for all of us: don&rsquo;t bother learning skills &ldquo;just in case&rdquo; unless you do it for fun. If you want to be a better software programmer, just practice programming. This also means that if you want to acquire practical skills, a school might not be the best place to go: a degree in English might not turn you into a better novelist.

Another consequence is that you should not assume transfer of expertise: if someone succeeded at one thing, you should not assume they will succeed at something else. If a famous baseball player starts a software company, wait before investing.
