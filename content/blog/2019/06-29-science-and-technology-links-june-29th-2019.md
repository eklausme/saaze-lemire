1. [Consuming pornography has no effect on sexual desire for one&rsquo;s partner](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10570314.2018.1564934).
1. [Exercise may increase the likelihood that a woman will become pregnant](https://dx.doi.org/10.1093/humupd/dmz013).
1. [Consuming more protein make it less likely that you will become frail as you age](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s00394-019-01978-7).
1. [There is no correlation between how often university professors fly and their academic success](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.jclepro.2019.04.109). Furthermore, academics who study environmental issues like global warming fly just as much as the other professors.
1. In mammals, the heart does not regenerate. Dead heart cells are dead and no replacement is produced. New research shows that this can be changed, in mice, by pumping them up with a small molecule called miR-294. [The treated mice saw good heart regeneration](https://www.templehealth.org/about/news/embryonic-microrna-fuels-heart-cell-regeneration-temple-researchers-show).
1. In human beings, an important part of the immune system, the thymus, simply disappears over time, leaving older people with a weaker immune system. [In mice, this can be reversed using transgenic exosomes](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fimmu.2019.00862/full).
