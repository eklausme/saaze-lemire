<p>Just a quick note about IEEE and similar professional organizations. When I was in academia, although they asserted copyright, their policies were more permissive than Elsevier&rsquo;s was. As an example, if I posted my paper to arxiv prior to it getting published in IEEE, they did not require me to remove the arxiv paper. They insisted only that the final published IEEE version (with their formatting, etc) not appear on arxiv.</p>
<p>So yes, while they still charge high for journals, they are quite OK with authors posting their work elsewhere in tandem with publishing with them.</p>
<p>(I assume things have not changed much since then).</p>

<p>Elsevier explicitly allows you to post the submitted version (not the final, journal-edited version) on your website. They very explicitly allows arXiv submissions.</p>
<p>The problem with authors posting on arXiv is not that journals and publishers go out of their way to prevent it. They do not. The real problem is that much of the literature would be locked up even if 99.9% of all papers going forward were on arXiv.</p>
