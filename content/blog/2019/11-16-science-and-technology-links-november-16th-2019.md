1. We have new technology to do genetic engineering on human beings (CRISPR). In a small clinical trial, the researchers tested it on live human subjects and [found it to be safe](https://clinicaltrials.gov/ct2/show/NCT03399448).
1. [Girls and boys have a similar intelligence according to psychometric tests, but girls do much better in school](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289606000171), and this is not due to their better verbal ability.
1. [Being illiterate is associated with dementia and cognitive decline in old age](https://n.neurology.org/content/early/2019/11/12/WNL.0000000000008587).
1. [Dumber people tend to smoke more cannabis](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0376871619304892), but cannabis itself does not appear to make people dumber.
1. [We transplanted pig skin onto human beings](https://onezero.medium.com/surgeons-transplanted-pig-skin-onto-humans-for-the-first-time-607fc519eb56).
1. [A large fraction of Ph.D. students seek psychological help for anxiety and depression](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41586-019-03459-7). The students often blame the Ph.D. supervisors.
1. [Researchers have apparently been able to reverse aging in the eye of old mice](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/710210v1). The mice eyes can then recover from a crushed nerve and from glaucoma.
