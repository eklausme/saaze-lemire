1. [There are nearly 70,000 centenarians in Japan](https://www.express.co.uk/news/world/1066014/Worlds-oldest-person-kane-tanaka-secrets-to-a-long-life).
1. [China&rsquo;s population fell by 1.27 million in 2018](https://www.today.ng/news/world/chinas-population-shrinks-despite-child-policy-184357).
1. [Obesity is associated with increased senescent cell burden and neuropsychiatric disorders, including anxiety and depression](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(18)30745-9). Clearing senescent cells could alleviate these symptons.
1. [Women who come from families where the mother is the breadwinner are less likely to pursue a science degree at university level](http://sticerd.lse.ac.uk/dps/pep/pep27.pdf).
1. [Stronger men live longer](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC2453303/):<br/>

> Muscular strength is inversely and independently associated with death from all causes and cancer in men, even after adjusting for cardiorespiratory fitness and other potential confounders.

1. Inflammation is a crude but effective part of our immune system that serves as a first line of defense. It is necessary but tends to get out of hand as we age. Arai et al. found that [your level of inflammation was a potential predictor of how likely you were to reach extreme old age](https://www.ebiomedicine.com/article/S2352-3964(15)30081-5/abstract):<br/>

>Inflammation is the prime candidate amongst potential determinants of mortality, capability and cognition up to extreme old age

1. [An article published by Nature argues for rejuvenation strategies](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41556-018-0206-0):<br/>

>Ageing is associated with the functional decline of all tissues and a striking increase in many diseases. Although ageing has long been considered a one-way street, strategies to delay and potentially even reverse the ageing process have recently been developed. Here, we review four emerging rejuvenation strategiesâ€”systemic factors, metabolic manipulations, senescent cell ablation and cellular reprogrammingâ€”and discuss their mechanisms of action, cellular targets, potential trade-offs and application to human ageing.

1. [Childhood leukaemia is a feature of developed societies and has to do with the fact that children are insufficiently exposed to bacteria and infections](https://www.theguardian.com/science/2018/dec/30/children-leukaemia-mel-greaves-microbes-protection-against-disease).
1. [China has landed a rover on the far side of the Moon](https://amp.cnn.com/cnn/2019/01/02/health/china-lunar-rover-far-moon-landing-intl/index.html).
1. [While climate change models predict that as the world warms, biomass will decompose more quickly, which would send a lot more carbon dioxide into the atmosphere, new research finds that it may work the other way around: warmer temperature may reduce decomposition and carbon emissions](https://blogs.agu.org/geospace/2019/01/03/climate-warming-experiment-finds-unexpected-results/).
1. [You can defeat Google&rsquo;s captchas (meant to prove you are a human being) by taking the audio test and feeding it back to Google&rsquo;s services to get a transcription](https://github.com/ecthros/uncaptcha2).
