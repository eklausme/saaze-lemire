<p>Computing has had a big effect, but assigning this to computer science departments is unjustified. Most practitioner&rsquo;s eyes glaze over when they see a PDF and use technology and practices developed in industry.</p>

<p>I am sympathetic to the point of view that only a small fraction of the progress in computing can be attributed to computer-science researchers, but we are starting from a small investment. The government-sponsored medical research is much richer, and so it should be judged accordingly.</p>
<p>We are spending more each year on research for single diseases than for all of computer science, with often no clinical translation in sight.</p>
<p>There is an accountability issue in medical research that is just not present in computer science.</p>

<p>On the subject of health research &#8211; I don&rsquo;t know many health researchers, and only a few more doctors, but they are almost universally motivated more by &ldquo;helping people&rdquo; than by what I consider scientific curiosity. Those that are more scientifically minded go into science or engineering disciplines.</p>
<p>I have had numerous discussions with doctors who don&rsquo;t understand basic statistics for example, who were arguing for certain types of screening. Lo and behold &#8211; those types of screening are finally being discarded.</p>

<p>I think that we have clear indications that medical researchers do not do much to &ldquo;help people&rdquo; in aggregate.</p>

<p>Damnit. Now you have challenged me to start doing pushups again. I recommend doing them first thing after you wake up, because you are too sleepy to feel them. üôÇ</p>
