1. Though deep learning has proven remarkably capable in many tasks like image classification, it is possible that the problems they are solving remarquably well are just [simpler than we think](https://medium.com/bethgelab/neural-networks-seem-to-follow-a-puzzlingly-simple-strategy-to-classify-images-f4229317261f):<br/>

> At its core our work shows that [neural networks] use the many weak statistical regularities present in natural images for classification and don&rsquo;t make the jump towards object-level integration of image parts like humans.


This challenges the view that deep learning is going to bring us much closer to human-level intelligence in the near future.
1. Though we age, it is unclear how our bodies keep track of the time (assuming they do). [Researchers claim that our blood cells could act as time keepers](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.12897). When you transplant organs from a donor, they typically behave according to the age of the recipient. However, blood cells are an exception: they keep the same age as the donor. What would happen if we were to replace all blood cells in your body with younger or older ones?
1. [A tenth of all coal is used to make steel](https://twitter.com/asymmetricinfo/status/1093884153735585792?s=21). This suggests that it might be harder than people expect to close coal mines and do away with fossil fuels entirely in the short or medium term.
1. [Elite powerlifters have suprising low testosterone (male homone) levels](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5804043/). This puts a dent in the theory that strong men have high testosterone levels.
1. [Chimpanzees learn to crack nuts faster than human beings](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38392-8). This challenges the model that human beings are cognitively superior.
1. [It seems that the male brain ages more rapidly than the female brain](https://www.pnas.org/content/pnas/early/2019/01/29/1815917116.full.pdf).
1. [Grant argues that vitamin D supplements reduce cancer rates](http://orthomolecular.activehosted.com/index.php?action=social&amp;chash=2723d092b63885e0d7c260cc007e8b9d.113&amp;ref=twitter&amp;hash=), but that medicine is slow to accept it.
1. [Women prefer more masculine looking men in richer countries](https://dspace.stir.ac.uk/handle/1893/28677#.XF78pBqu-fA). I do not have any intuition as to why this might be.
1. [Geographers claim that the arrival of Europeans to America, and the subsequent reduction of population (due mostly to diseases) lead to a global cooling of worldwide temperatures](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0277379118307261). It seems highly speculative to me that there was any measurable effect.
1. [The New York Times has a piece of a billionnaire called Brutoco who says that &ldquo;he spends much of his time flying around the world lecturing on climate change&rdquo;](https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/20/greathomesanddestinations/20away.html) and lives in a gorgeous villa surrounded by a golf course. There is no talk of his personal carbon footprint.
