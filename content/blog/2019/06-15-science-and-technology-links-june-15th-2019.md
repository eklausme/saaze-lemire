- We know that naked mole rats are ageless mammals, in the sense that their mortality rate appear constant (not increasing with age). We believe that many sea creatures are similarly ageless. However, new research shows that [sea urchins actually age in reverse](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0531556519300592): their mortality rate diminishes with age. Many trees also age in reverse: older trees are harder to kill. 
- [Cholesterol levels and mortality follow a U-curve](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41598-018-38461-y), meaning that you can have too little and too much cholesterol. Hence, it may actually be bad for you to lower your cholesterol levels too much. 
- [Some of your cells are nearly as old as you are while many others are brand new](https://www.salk.edu/news-release/how-old-are-your-organs-to-scientists-surprise-organs-are-a-mix-of-young-and-old-cells/), and old cells can be found in many organs, such as in your liver and not just in your brain.

- It seems that being a large school does not necessary help you dominate in the online education market: [&ldquo;The decade now ending has seen a dramatic reduction in the size of the largest online school, both in total enrollment and relative to all other schools.&rdquo;](https://philonedtech.com/clay-shirky-on-mega-universities-and-scale/) (Shirky) This makes sense to me: online education is not a capital-intensive market. A few smart people can build great courses in a short time. Furthermore, having a local presence is an asset in education, even if your courses are entirely online. (Credit: Downes)
- Athletes and gold medalists live longer than the rest of us, despite the stress and the injuries that a lifetime of competition brings. [Did you know that high-level Chess players also live longer?](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0196938) 
- Many companies offer fancy diagnosis services for the very rich. [These companies are not doing so well](https://www.nature.com/articles/d41587-019-00016-5). Simply put, being able to learn everything that is wrong or could be wrong with you, is not necessarily a net positive. In fact, preventative medical diagnosis has a poor track record all around. It causes stress, obviously. It may also entice people to engage in unhelpful therapies.
