title: "The price of a MacBook Air worldwide"
---



Apple sells identical laptops worldwide. There might be small differences with respect to power adaptors and so forth, but the laptops are the same internally. Of course, there are differences in taxes but Apple quote prices with taxes included. So I went shopping for a basic MacBook Air, in different countries, using Apple&rsquo;s web site.

USA                      |US$1099                  |US$1099                  |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
Canada                   |CA$1449                  |US$1089                  |
Japan                    |￥119,800               |US$1120                  |
Australia                |A$1,699                  |US$1146                  |
France                   |1 249,00 €             |US$1374                  |


According to these numbers, the cheapest MacBooks are in Canada and the most expensive ones are in France.

In countries where taxes vary by province or state, the Apple tax estimate might be wrong for some locations.
