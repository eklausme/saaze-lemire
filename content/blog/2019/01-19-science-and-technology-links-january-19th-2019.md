1. [Losing even just a bit of weight can be enough to restore fertility in women](https://bmcobes.biomedcentral.com/articles/10.1186/s40608-015-0077-x).
1. Digital technology does not appear to have a significant negative effect on teenagers, according to [an article published by Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-018-0506-1).
1. According to [an article published by Nature](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-018-04616-8), woody vegetation cover over sub-Saharan Africa increased by 8% over the past three decades. This is part of a larger trend: the Earth is getting greener.
1. [The number of children in India has peaked](https://ourworldindata.org/indias-population-growth-will-come-to-an-end). This suggests that the population of India will peak soon as well.
1. Scientists are looking for chemical factors that either decrease or increase with age: normalizing these factors could slow or reverse aging. [Nature reports on a factor called MANF](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-018-0023-6) which decreases with age in mice, human beings and flies. [It seems than MANF supplements could have anti-aging benefits](https://www.buckinstitute.org/news/manf-identifed-as-a-rejuvenating-factor-in-parabiosis/).
1. [Netflix is approaching 150 million subscribers](https://www.cnn.com/2019/01/17/media/netflix-earnings-q4/index.html). This means that about 2% of the world&rsquo;s population is made of Netflix subscribers. This almost certainly underestimates the true reach of Netflix.
1. [In an article in the reputed Guardian newspaper from 2004](https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2004/feb/22/usnews.theobserver), we can read:<br/>

> 
A secret report, suppressed by US defence chiefs and obtained by The Observer, warns that major European cities will be sunk beneath rising seas as Britain is plunged into a &lsquo;Siberian&rsquo; climate by 2020. Nuclear conflict, mega-droughts, famine and widespread rioting will erupt across the world. (&hellip;) Already (&hellip;) the planet is carrying a higher population than it can sustain. By 2020 &lsquo;catastrophic&rsquo; shortages of water and energy supply will become increasingly harder to overcome, plunging the planet into war.

1. Our brains are made of white and grey matter. [Obesity correlates with lower gray matter volume in the brain](http://n.neurology.org/content/early/2019/01/09/WNL.0000000000006879).
1. Men and women have (statistically) different cognitive abilities, with women being better at verbal tasks whereas men are better at spatial tasks. This survey concludes that [homosexuals have abilities closer to the other sex](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0149763417302737):

> The meta-analysis revealed that homosexual men performed like heterosexual women in both male-favouring (e.g., spatial cognition) and female-favouring (e.g., verbal fluency) cognitive tests, while homosexual women performed like heterosexual men only in male-favouring tests. The magnitude of the sexual orientation difference varied across cognitive domains (larger for spatial abilities).
