<p>On the wind turbines, I think the result was more limited. At least in my read, they said surface temperatures rise due to mixing of layers of air. That&rsquo;s quite a bit different than talking about global warming or global climate changes; this appeared to be a more isolated effect.</p>
<p>Thanks for pointing to these though. I hadn&rsquo;t seen this or the Facebook result (which also seems more limited, though still interesting it is possible at all).</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the concerns regarding global warming have mostly to do with surface temperature. From the paper : &ldquo;We find that generating today&rsquo;s US electricity demand with wind power would warm Continental US surface temperatures by 0.24Â°C.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Maybe your argument is that it won&rsquo;t warm the stratosphere&#8230; ?</p>

<p>From the paper itself:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Wind&rsquo;s overall environmental impacts are surely less than fossil energy. Yet, as the energy system is decarbonized, decisions between wind and solar should be informed by estimates of their climate impacts.&rdquo;</p>
