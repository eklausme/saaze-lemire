<p>A copy of the report for the Pentagon is at <a href="https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/An_Abrupt_Climate_Change_Scenario_and_Its_Impl.pdf" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.iatp.org/sites/default/files/An_Abrupt_Climate_Change_Scenario_and_Its_Impl.pdf</a> . It presents &ldquo;a climate change scenario that although not the most likely, is plausible. &#8230; In this report, as an alternative to the scenarios of gradual climatic warming that are so common, we outline an abrupt climate change scenario patterned after the 100-year event that occurred about 8,200 years ago.&rdquo;</p>
