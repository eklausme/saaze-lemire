<p>Drinking juice&#8230;<br/>
What everybody overlook about &ldquo;healthy juice&rdquo; is that it is very, very loaded with fructose and in quickly assimilated form (all liquid, no &ldquo;ballast&rdquo;) and stresses the liver almost as badly as alcohol.</p>

<p>For the first link on the consumption of sugary drinks (including juice) I wonder how they dealt with time in their statistics. That is, I presume that when diagnosed with cancer, people are quite likely to make lifestyle changes, including changes in diet. It seems possible that one of these changes might be drinking more fruit juice, either for energy, or in the possibly mistaken belief that it&rsquo;s a healthier choice. I scanned the article and supplementary data, but didn&rsquo;t see any mention of longitudinal changes like this. Is there a &ldquo;best practice&rdquo; in accounting for this?</p>

<p>As far as I can tell, the study canâ€™t establish causality as it is a prospective study. So there are probably many confounding factors&#8230;</p>
<p>To me, the interest is that it challenges our preconceived notion that juices are healthy (which they may yet be, but where is the proof?)</p>
