<p>I&rsquo;m in the same boat as you, do most of my work in C/C++, Java, but instead of Python, I use R (so for both I&rsquo;m mainly interested in only the libraries, so R wins out here for me; and we all know so many of the libraries for both are written in C/C++). I&rsquo;ve recently taken an interest in Rust and Julia. You left Julia out of your blog, so I&rsquo;m curious about your thoughts. I&rsquo;m mostly interested in scientific programming, specifically of the statistical kind. Overall, I use what language works best for each scenario, and my methods I publish are increasingly comprised of multiple languages. Also, hello from Montreal!</p>

<p>Julia came out in 2012, so I should have included it!!! Thanks for pointing it out.</p>

<p>You can safely predict (read: extrapolate) that immature things will mature, like having a larger scale data crunching libraries, or a bit more memory.<br/>
What is already mature, like C++, is only getting more fashionable wrapping. So can extrapolate, but really, it&rsquo;s the end of the curve.<br/>
Things that are completely new, you cannot predict. No curve to extrapolate.<br/>
I predict that in 10 years, we&rsquo;ll have more fusion of big data with machine learning applied to everyday life.<br/>
Me: Bot, please remind me to get potatoes next time I&rsquo;m in the supermarket with the car.<br/>
Bot: The shopping list is fairly long already. How &rsquo;bout I order it all now?</p>
