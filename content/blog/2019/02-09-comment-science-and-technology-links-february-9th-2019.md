<p>Elite powerlifters are probably the biggest users of <abbr title="performance-enhancing drugs">PEDs</abbr> after elite bodybuilders. Drug testing is pretty lax in powerlifting compared to olympic sports (and even there testing is being evaded). The self-report on steroid use isn&#039;t reliable, and neither is the Testosterone/<abbr title="Luteinizing hormone">LH level</abbr> (for example, LH levels are affected by <abbr>SERMs</abbr>, which are commonly used). (Also, I believe testosterone is temporarily depressed after extreme physical exertion, though I&#039;m not sure it would be substantially different between powerlifting and weightlifting.)</p>

<p>Some of coal consumed in making steel is used for heat, some of it is used to reduce the iron oxides to iron and the rest usually ends up as part of the alloy.</p>
<p>There are places where there is a source of &ldquo;stranded gas&rdquo; that cannot be practically exported by pipeline or tanker. Sometimes a steel mill is constucted nearby that converts the natural gas to hydrogen and then uses it to reduce iron ore and yield carbon-free steel. With the (big) exception reforming natural gas to hydrogen, the process is carbon-free. Regular carbon steel can also be produced by a similar process but there is some demand for carbon-free iron in metallurgy that commands a higher price so until that demand is satisfied this would probably not be done.</p>
<p>Technically, hydrogen can be produced by nuclear or solar sources to create carbon-free or even carbon negative steel (as carbon becomes part of the alloy). The scale of hydrogen production required is mind boggling. The hundreds of millions of tonnes of hydrogen currently used in Haber-Bosch plants for producing fertilizers would be preferably displaced by such hydrogen sources before anyone would dream of using hydrogen for steel production anywhere other than by a stranded gas field.</p>

<p>If you inject testosterone for some period, your body will produce less and your balls will shrink as a result. When you stop or taper off, it will take some time for your body to get back in gear with normal endogenous testosterone production. That could explain the low testosterone in powerlifters.</p>

<p>The use of coal to make steel is on the way out, as other proicesses are now becoming cheaper. <a href="https://www.thespec.com/news-story/4190319-u-s-steel-natural-gas-process-will-soon-replace-coke/" rel="nofollow ugc">https://www.thespec.com/news-story/4190319-u-s-steel-natural-gas-process-will-soon-replace-coke/</a></p>
