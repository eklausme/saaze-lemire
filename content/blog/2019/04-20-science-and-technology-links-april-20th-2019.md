This is related to the observation that [immigrants are four times more likely to become millionaires](https://medium.com/wise-heroes/immigrants-are-four-times-more-likely-to-become-millionaires-by-mark-j-quann-5a47658ead09).

It seems quite safe and probably more effective than current drugs.1. [A stem-cell therapy for knee arthritis got solid results during a clinical trial.](https://stemcellsjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/sctm.18-0183)1. [It seems that you can bring back some brain function hours after death](https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2019/04/17/714289322/scientists-restore-some-function-in-the-brains-of-dead-pigs) (in pigs).
