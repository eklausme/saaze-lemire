1. [The computation capacity needed by artificial intelligence doubles every 3.4 months.](https://hai.stanford.edu/sites/g/files/sbiybj10986/f/ai_index_2019_report.pdf) In parallel, we are making fast progress in hardware and software: what took three hours a year and half ago can now take less than two minutes.
1. In Luxembourg, a small European country, [all public transportation is free](https://www.archdaily.com/908252/luxembourg-becomes-first-country-to-make-all-public-transit-free). Luxembourg has also a gay prime minister who is married.

1. Many worry that computers and artificial intelligence will destroy so many jobs so quickly that human workers will never recover. [Scholl and Hanson find no evidence for the emergence of such a trend](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3496364).
1. [Crows can use tools and solve multi-step puzzles](https://www.bbc.com/future/article/20191211-crows-could-be-the-smartest-animal-other-than-primates).
1. As we age, we accumulate defective non-dividing cells called senescent cells. The older we get the more quickly we accumulate them. [The progression is exponential](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-019-13192-4).
