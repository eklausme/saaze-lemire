<p>The drone attack listed for point number six did not “[wipe] out 50% of Saudi Arabia’s oil supply,” but instead forced a temporary 50% cut to their daily production.</p>
<p>The attack was on two sites, one of which was attacked with cruise missiles while the other was attacked with drones.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. It is true that this specific disruption was short (resolved in a matter of weeks).</p>
