1. Aging is associated with a reduction in tissue NAD levels. In turn, this is believed to be associated with physical decline. It is not entirely clear what makes the NAD level decline, but [it seems that it might be caused by the accumulation of senescent cells](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/609438v1). As we age, we tend to accumulate these non-functional and slightly harmful &ldquo;dead&rdquo; cells called &ldquo;senescent cells&rdquo;. We now have drugs called senolytics that can remove some of these senescent cells, with at least one ongoing clinical trial.
