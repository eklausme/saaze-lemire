<p>Gore&rsquo;s worth what, $200 million? Hardly &ldquo;common folk&rdquo;, if that means average or medium income. And he owns other residences which consume even more power. Wouldn&rsquo;t it make more sense to look at his overall environmental impact compared to other ultra-millionaires? If as a class they have a higher impact than &ldquo;common folk&rdquo;, then that would be another argument in favor of a global wealth tax.</p>
<p>If it&rsquo;s a question of Gore&rsquo;s hypocrisy, is it hypocrisy for a 4-pack-a-day smoker who&rsquo;s now down to 2 packs to tell people to not smoke because it&rsquo;s bad for one&rsquo;s heath and addictive?</p>
<p>The &ldquo;Scandinavians with weird names&rdquo; page doesn&rsquo;t work for me from Sweden (I&rsquo;m a reverse emigrant) because Slate&rsquo;s GDPR page is broken. Did it mention that Scandinavians who emigrated to the US also supported socialist ideas in the US? For example, Joel Emmanuel HÃ¤gglund, better known as Joe Hill. Or the left-wing Minnesota Farmerâ€“Labor Party, which included Hubert Humphrey (Norwegian parents), Floyd B. Olson (Norwegian and Swedish parents), and Hjalmar Petersen (born in Denmark).</p>
