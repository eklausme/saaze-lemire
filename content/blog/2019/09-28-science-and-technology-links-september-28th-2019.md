1. [Researchers have effectively rejuvenated the damaged skin of mice by using &ldquo;exosomes&rdquo;](https://pubs.acs.org/doi/10.1021/acsnano.9b04384). These are packages that cells send in their environment, and it appears that other cells react positively to exosomes in some conditions. The therapy is non-invasive (no needle!) and it appears to be superior to existing skin rejuvenation treatments (e.g., retinol, stem cells). Skin thickness and collagen production were both improved.
1. [Researchers have effectively created new neurons in the brain of mice by converting existing glial cells (which are abundant) into neurons](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ymthe.2019.09.003). This could be used one day to help patients recover from brain injuries or strokes.
1. [About one in six death in the USA is due to lead exposure](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lanpub/article/PIIS2468-2667(18)30025-2/fulltext). [Lead accumulates in your body over time and significantly increases your risks of cardiovascular diseases](https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/A-prospective-study-of-bone-lead-concentration-and-Weisskopf-Jain/886040a9de0f9b58e1e7dae5ada7d383b348cea1), among other bad things. There are chelation therapies to lower your lead levels, but they are not in wide use even though [it is surprisingly effective at improving the health of some sick people](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0735109716015989).
