__FAQ__

1. __I copied and paste code form your blog post and it does not compile, it contained a massive security hole, it contained a terrible bug or it crashed my computer. Can I blame you?__ No. Lemire&rsquo;s rule:<br/>

> Blogging is literature, not engineering. Code taken from a blog post should not be expected to work, it is meant to illustrate an idea. Don&rsquo;t build production systems by copying and pasting random code from the Internet. It will not end well.

1. __Can I write a blog post for you?__ No. This is a personal blog.
1. __We have this great new product or book, would you write about it on your blog&hellip;__ Maybe. If I find the book or product interesting. Please note that I only read books on paper, so do not send me a PDF hoping for me to read it.
1. __I have this great page that relates to a blog post you have written, can I share the link with you?&hellip;__ Yes. However, do not expect me to add a link to it.
