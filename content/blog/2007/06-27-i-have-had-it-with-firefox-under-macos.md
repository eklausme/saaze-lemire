title: "I have had it with Firefox under MacOS"
---



I have been a Firefox user for at least 4 years now. I generally enjoy the unrivaled flexibility Firefox offers. Firefox can be tweaked in so many ways. As far as I can tell, for standard-based web development, it is the best browser around. It also does pretty well on standard compliance, while Opera can give it a run for its money.

However, at least under MacOS, Firefox has becoming too annoying to use, so I have switched to [Safari](http://www.apple.com/safari/) for the time being. I think that Firefox supports a wider range of sites and features than Safari, but here are some things that I cannot live with:

- Firefox, presumably because of its spellchecker, can&rsquo;t keep up with my typing. I type fast. I type all day. I will not tolerate any noticeable delay between the moment I type a letter and the moment it appears on my screen. Sorry. I have crazily fast CPUs, there is no way a good programmer can&rsquo;t get rid of these delays unless the application is bloated. In fact, I have noticed that several modern applications can&rsquo;t keep up with my typing. Am I the only one who types too fast for Firefox?
- Downloading a PDF or Word file is a pain. Some dialog box appears and there is a long delay while Firefox does <i>something</i>, before I get to see my file. No good. I am a busy fellow, do not make me wait for a dialog box 3 seconds 50 times a day.


What I&rsquo;ll miss the most? Firefox has customized search boxes, so that you can quickly search wikipedia, for example. Thankfully, it is possible to have similar feature with [Sogudi](http://www.kitzkikz.com/Sogudi) under Safari. Not quite as nice, but close enough.

And Safari is __fast__. Oh yes, very __fast__.

Now, if someone could take the bloat out of NeoOffice, I&rsquo;d be a happy fellow.

(This should not be seen as a vote against open source. I was a Konqueror user when Apple came in, took Konqueror and made Safari out of it. To a large extend, Safari is open source software. We just do not notice as much.)
