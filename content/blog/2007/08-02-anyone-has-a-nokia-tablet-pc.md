title: "Anyone has a Nokia Tablet PC?"
---



I am thinking about buying a [Nokia N800 Internet Tablet PC](https://www.amazon.com/Nokia-N800-Internet-Tablet-PC/dp/tech-data/B000MK4GGM/ref=de_a_smtd/002-2003601-1833624&amp;tag=daniellemires-20). This seems like a cool replacement for my Palm m505. There is just a [huge number of free applications for it](http://maemo.org/). There are a few gotchas, no doubt, but I&rsquo;d be interested in hearing from anyone who owns such a device?
