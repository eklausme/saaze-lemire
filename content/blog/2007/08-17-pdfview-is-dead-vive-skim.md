title: "PDFView is dead, vive Skim!"
---



PDFView, my trusty MacOS PDF viewer is dead. But fortunately, [Skim](http://skim-app.sourceforge.net/developers.html) comes to the rescue. Skim has pretty much the same features as PDFView. For example, you can tell it to automatically reload a PDF file when it changed on disk, which is a needed feature if you are going to use LaTeX seriously. Also, though this is not without flaws, Skim allows you to annotate PDF files in fancy ways: to do so, it cheats since it does not actually modify the PDF file itself, but rather the file&rsquo;s metadata&hellip; which means that if you share the PDF file, by email, the annotations will silently disappear. Fortunately, there are ways around it.

I have never understood why Adobe and others make it so difficult to annotate PDF files. This is really an historical mistake.
