[Eliotte nails WS-* web services.](http://cafe.elharo.com/xml/north-and-south/) There has been constant attempts from WS-* web service proponents to claim that there was one big tool shed and that people could pick their favorite type of web services. The hidden message is that there are various options, that WS-* might be best for serious work whereas REST web services are better for the little guy. In other words, WS-* didn&rsquo;t fail, we just have different solutions to different problems. __It is not so.__

> 
WS-* is North Korea and REST is South Korea. While REST will go on to become an economic powerhouse with steadily increasing standards of living for all its citizens, WS-* is doomed to sixty years of starvation, poverty, tyranny, and defections until it eventually collapses from its own fundamental inadequacies and is absorbed into the more sensible policies of its neighbor to the South.

The analogy isn&rsquo;t as silly as it sounds either. North Korean/Soviet style â€œcommunismâ€ fails because it believes massive central planning works better than the individual decisions of millions of economic actors. WS-* fails because it believes massive central planning works better than the individual decisions of millions of web sites.


So there you go. Please be a WS-* advocate if you want, but you are applying nice ideas that will never work no matter what. There is no truce, you are just lost souls.
