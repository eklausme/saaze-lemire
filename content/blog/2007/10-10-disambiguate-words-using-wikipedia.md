A common problem in information retrieval is that words are ambiguous. That is a fancy way of saying that you cannot tell the meaning of a word when you take it out of context. Some people claim that this problem must be solved by using the Semantic Web. I have long advocated that the Semantic Web is more of a solution in search of a problem.

We already have some good strategies regarding disambiguation, but I have wondered recently why we can&rsquo;t use wikipedia to disambiguate words. After all, wikipedia knows the difference between [Java (the island)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java) and [Java (the programming language)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29). It turns out that Google has implemented and patented this very idea!

See? Who needs RDF to disambiguate words?
