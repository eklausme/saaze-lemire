title: "What happens when everyone owns a telescope"

I reminded a member of our staff of the following quote yesterday:

> Computer science is no more about computers than astronomy is about telescopes. (Dijkstra) 


But what happens to astronomy when everyone owns a telescope?

If you had millions of people using telescopes for 8 hours a day, what would happen of the astronomers? Can you still continue to do astronomy as if only there were only a few serious astronomers in the world?
