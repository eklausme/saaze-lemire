---



Together with Gilbert Paquette and Petko Valtchev, I received a $1 million grant from the Canadian Foundation for Innovation to build a Research-oriented Data Warehouse called ERASME. The Data Warehouse will include terabytes of storage and a cluster of powerful machines for high performance computing.

Other researchers involved include Martin Brooks (NRC), Abdulmotaleb El Saddik (U. Ottawa), Ã‰tienne Gagnon (UQAM), Robert Godin (UQAM), Owen Kaser (UNB), Hakim Lounis (UQAM), FranÃ§ois Magnan (UQAM), Olga Marino (UQAM), Hafedh Mili (UQAM), and Guy Tremblay (UQAM).
