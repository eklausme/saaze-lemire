<p>I get to teach a course on programming languages come January and I&rsquo;ve been thinking of how to avoid too much of the traditional classroom approach. Students who have grown up online don&rsquo;t respond well to it and I may be lucky enough to have the resources to try something a little different. Thanks for the link to Downes&rsquo; website.</p>
<p>As for the industrial workspace notion, I don&rsquo;t even live in the same city as the university I&rsquo;m registered in for my doctorate program and I do some of my best writing when I head to the public library. Assuming one has enough discipline, there is no need to head to the lab when you aren&rsquo;t tied there for equipment reasons.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment.</p>
<p>I do not work in coffee shops, but I wrote my Ph.D. thesis in one. Think it is odd? Harry Potter was written in a coffee shop. Actually, there is evidence that white noise can enhance concentration, not reduce it.</p>
<p>But this is beside the point, the coffee shop here is a symbol. The Computer Science laboratories I have worked in were not any quieter than a coffee shop, they were just far more formal, with straight chairs, designated chairs and closed doors.</p>
<p>I do not actually think that universities should turn into coffee shops, but they should mimick them more than the mimick factories. Who needs fixed hours, routine, rigid rules?</p>
<p>I do my best research sitting by my fireplace, at home, with loads of coffee.</p>

<p>I agree that classical hierarchical classes may not be the best approach to education.</p>
<p>But I am also quite sure that top-notch computer science research is mostly not done, and will not be done, from coffee shops and bars.</p>
<p>Research takes lots of work and concentration. I doubt that being creative, having good ideas and knowing interesting people is the key factor to success in a field like computer science.</p>
<p>It is a good starting point, but not more.</p>
