title: "What to get with your Nintendo Wii?"

I guess many people are getting Wiis right about now. I have had mine for a few months. Here are my recommendations:

- [The Sims 2: Castaway](https://www.amazon.com/Electronic-Arts-15819-The-Sims/dp/B000QAY00A/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=videogames&#038;qid=1198549652&#038;sr=1-1). You do not need to know what the [sims](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Sims_2) are. If you can cope with games requiring planning, some puzzles, but relatively little action, this game is for you. Reminds me of the [TV show &ldquo;Lost](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lost_%28TV_series%29).&rdquo;
- [Super Mario Galaxy](https://www.amazon.com/Nintendo-Super-Mario-Galaxy/dp/B000FQ9QVI/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=videogames&#038;qid=1198549797&#038;sr=1-1). A relaxing and fun platform game. Very innovative, in a strange way. Reminds me of the [Little Prince](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Little_Prince) by [Saint-Exup√©ry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antoine_de_Saint-Exup%C3%A9ry).
- [Resident Evil 4](https://www.amazon.com/Capcom-35003-Resident-Evil-4/dp/B000P46NKC/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=videogames&#038;qid=1198549897&#038;sr=1-1). This is an older strategic/action game, retrofitted to use the Wii controls. Well done and scary!
- [Medal of Honor: Heroes 2](https://www.amazon.com/Medal-of-Honor-Heroes-2/dp/B000RHXD1O/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&#038;s=videogames&#038;qid=1198549993&#038;sr=1-1). I think that first-person shooters are getting old, but this one uses the Wii controls to good effect. Oddly immersive. 
- Opera Web browser for the Wii. I am typing this using my Wii right now. You can purchase the browser in the online boutique directly on the Wii. Well worth the money. Opera is a good browser.
