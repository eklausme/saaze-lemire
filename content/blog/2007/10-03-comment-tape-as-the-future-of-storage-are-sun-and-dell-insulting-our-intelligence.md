<p>I think Sun is grasping at straws. As soon as <a href="https://expert-opinion.blogspot.com/2007/09/sun-going-way-of-silicon-graphics.html" rel="nofollow">they became a Windows OEM</a>, they were toast. They&rsquo;ll never be able to compete on price with cheap PC makers, and so they&rsquo;re desperately trying to come up with a way to differentiate their products. It&rsquo;s like a company trying to figure out a way to get people to pay $60,000 for a car indistinguishable from a Ford Taurus. Note that this doesn&rsquo;t preclude the ability of a car manufacturer from making a $60,000 car; nor does it mean that the only way to compete is via price.</p>
<p>As far as tape is concerned, I&rsquo;d say you&rsquo;re partly right. But, what if I want 500TB of storage and can accept a fair amount of access time delay? A tape library with only one or two actual tape drives will be cheaper than a bunch of disk drives. The incremental cost of adding another <em>tape</em> is much smaller than adding another HD.</p>
