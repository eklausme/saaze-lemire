<div class="comment-content">
<p>As a footnote, Library and Archives Canada is also worried about this, of course. Their mandate is to archive (some) of these exabytes &#8211; the ones that matter or can be considered part of the &ldquo;National Heritage&rdquo; (<a href="http://www.collectionscanada.ca/cdis/index-e.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.collectionscanada.ca/cdis/index-e.html</a>). So (one of) their problem(s) is &#8211; how do we tell what matters and what doesn&rsquo;t? Given limited management ability / space / archivists etc., do we archive / annotate Daniel&rsquo;s and Andre&rsquo;s blogs or Nelly Furtado&rsquo;s MySpace site?</p>
<p>As far as absolute numbers of exabytes go, I don&rsquo;t think that&rsquo;s an especially good measure for anything. YouTube videos take up quite a lot of space but there aren&rsquo;t more than a few million. It&rsquo;s the &ldquo;objects&rdquo; and the information about them that matters.</p>
<p>Although the question of what a &ldquo;digital object&rdquo; actually consists of is also in question. Should it be the picture, or the picture with the text or the picture with the text in the blog&#8230;?</p>
