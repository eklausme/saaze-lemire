title: "Google Presentations: What did I tell you?"
---



Less than a year ago, I predicted that [Google would come up with a PowerPoint-like tool](/lemire/blog/2006/12/14/my-predictions-for-year-2007/). They [did it](https://docs.google.com/). And you know what? It is pretty good.

Downes [had this to say about it](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=41735):

> What I&rsquo;d really like is a slide library I can simply draw from to create presentations. But you can&rsquo;t even drag and drop slides inside presentations.


To this, I reply:

- You can&rsquo;t drag and drop slides within your presentation, but you can move them in the slide desk using buttons to achieve the same result.
- You can&rsquo;t drag and drop slides from one presentation to another, but you can copy a slide in a presentation and copy it in another.
