In [Software Is Hard](http://www.gamearchitect.net/Articles/SoftwareIsHard.html), Kyle Wilson proposes a law of software development:

> It is impossible, by examining any significant piece of completed code, to determine within a factor of two how many man-hours it took to produce that code.


(Oh! I think that he is being generous. I doubt you can estimate reliably within a factor of 10 how long it took to complete a non trivial piece of software. Even if you know who did it and in what conditions.)

And a corollary:

> If you can&rsquo;t tell how long a piece of code would take when you have the finished product available, what chance do you think you have before the first line of code is written?



This is a very convincing case for why [writing and maintaining software are not engineering activities](/lemire/blog/2007/02/24/writing-and-maintaining-software-are-not-engineering-activities/).
