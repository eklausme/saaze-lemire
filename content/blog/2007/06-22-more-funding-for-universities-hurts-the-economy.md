title: "More Funding for Universities Hurts the Economy"
---



Stephen Downes [points us](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=40597) to an [article](http://insidehighered.com/news/2007/06/22/growth) about the apparent negative correlation between economic growth an university funding. Here are some good quotes:

>Universities, while they&rsquo;re virtuous institutions â€¦ do not necessarily promote economic growth and development, because resources have to be taken from the private sector or somewhere to pay for them


>There is very, very, very weak evidence that more spending on state universities actually leads to more college graduates â€” let alone higher-quality ones.
