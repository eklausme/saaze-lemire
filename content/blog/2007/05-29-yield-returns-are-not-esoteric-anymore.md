title: "Yield returns are not esoteric anymore"
---



I did a little bit of research on the Web today, following a statement by my friend Owen to the effect that yield returns were not something Joe Programmer could be expected to know about.

Turns out that yield returns are supported in C#, Visual Basic (VB.NET), Python and Ruby.

So, yes, I&rsquo;d say that if you are programmer out there, you ought to know about yield returns.
