[VirtueDesktops](http://virtuedesktops.info/index.php/downloads/) is an open source virtual desktop application. It did crash on me, but all I had to do was restart it and everything was fine: it was a graceful crash. It is pretty sharp software. It requires Mac OS X 10.4 or higher, and will run on both PowerPC and Intel-based macs.
