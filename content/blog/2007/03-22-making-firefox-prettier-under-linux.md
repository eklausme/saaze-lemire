title: "Making Firefox Prettier under Linux"

I think Firefox is a capable browser. It is also multiplatform. Unfortunately, I feel that the Linux version is sometimes far uglier than the Windows version. This has to do, partly, with the fact that Firefox uses GTK. This Gentoo HOWTO on how to Integrate Firefox with KDE helped me quite a bit making Firefox look nicer.

Yes. Looks do matter.
