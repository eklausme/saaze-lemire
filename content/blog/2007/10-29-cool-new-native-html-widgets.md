title: "Cool new native HTML widgets"
---



I name this the coolest hack of the week. [Glen](https://zzzoot.blogspot.com/2007/10/tag-cloud-inspired-html-select-lists.html) decided to apply the tag-cloud idea to other HTML widgets. See this example and recall that I am only using straight HTML/CSS (no ECMAScript, no flash):
<form><select size="5"><option style="font-size: 80%;" value="Aggregators"> Aggregators</option><option style="font-size: 155%;" value="Blogs"> Blogs</option><option style="font-size: 80%;" value="Collaboration"> Collaboration</option><option style="font-size: 125%;" value="Joy of Use"> Joy of Use</option><option style="font-size: 80%;" value="Podcasting"> Podcasting</option><option style="font-size: 125%;" value="RSS"> RSS</option><option style="font-size: 200%;" value="Web 2.0"> Web 2.0</option><option style="font-size: 80%;" value="XHTML"> XHTML</option></select></form>

__Update__: according to BenoÃ®t Boudeau, it does not work under IE 6. According to Kamel Aouiche, it does not work under IE 7. It does not work under Safari.

Why is this important? Because you can convey extra information along with a selection widget. You could ask people to select which type of product they want while making more popular product appear in a larger font. In other words, __you can hide a recommender system in the selection process__.

We just need a good name for these new widgets. Cloudgets? Taglets?
