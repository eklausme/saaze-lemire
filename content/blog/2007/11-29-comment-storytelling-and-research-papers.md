<p>Stories generally rely on the power of surprise, withholding important information as long as possible, to maximize dramatic effect. I believe that a good scientific paper should do the exact opposite: the most important information should be given as soon as possible; for example, in the title or in the abstract. Very early in the paper, you should give the reader a general framework for understanding what will follow. You should seek to maximize clarity and understanding. Stories, on the other hand, thrive on mystery, ambiguity, and vague allusions.</p>
