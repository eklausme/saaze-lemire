title: "Why donÂ´t people use university libraries?"
---



I was recently asked by someone who manages a librarian newsletter, why I thought that library tools did not make it in the Top 100 Tools for Learning by Jane Hart. I immediately replied that Google Scholar made it to the list.

Then I had to think back. What about the last time I used a library tool (other than Google Scholar)? I can remember bad feelings like &ldquo;why is the user interface so complicated?&rdquo;. Then &ldquo;why can&rsquo;t I find what I am looking for?&rdquo;. And &ldquo;why do I have to choose which database I want to search in, can&rsquo;t it just search them all?&rdquo;. And &ldquo;why do I have to go to another, different tool, to know who cited this paper and when?&rdquo;.

Beyond these frustrations, I came up with some more specific reasons why library tools are not used:

- They are not user-friendly. They were clearly designed with the &ldquo;we shall train the users&rdquo; motto in mind. Sorry. I do not want any training. I want you and your tools to get out of my way and let me find what I am looking for.
- You may not consider this workshop paper that appeared on the Web two months ago a &ldquo;worthwhile&rdquo; reference, but I do.
- It is ok for you to have to mail order a journal article and wait a week for it. Me? I want it now, on my screen, or else&hellip;
- So, your search engine covers more prestigious journals than Google Scholar? It can count citations appearing in prestigious journals with absolute accuracy? Because, of course, you can only trust the &ldquo;reliable sources&rdquo;. Well, you are a librarian and you care about these things, but I am a researcher and I do not care as much as you do. I have a social network, I know who are the researchers you can absolutely trust, those who I should investigate further. In minutes or even seconds, I can tell about the quality of a paper. It is not a problem for me to trim out junk: the Web has trained me well to do it. Students should learn to do the same.
