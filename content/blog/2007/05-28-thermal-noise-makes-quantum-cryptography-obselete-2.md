title: "Thermal Noise makes Quantum Cryptography obselete?"
---



The New Scientist (and slashdot) reports that a very simple method that basically achieves what million-dollars Quantum Cryptography set out to achieve: unbreakable two-way communication. This is due to Laszlo Kish. His papers are on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/abs/physics/0612153) and they appear pretty convincing, but I have left the world of Physics a long time ago.

Bruce Schneier [describes it](https://www.schneier.com/crypto-gram/archives/2005/1215.html#15) in those terms:

> How would you feel if you invested millions of dollars in quantum cryptography, and then learned that you could do the same thing with a few 25-cent Radio Shack components?



And he concludes:

>Basically, if Kish&rsquo;s scheme is secure, it&rsquo;s superior to quantum communications in every respect: price, maintenance, speed, vibration, thermal resistance and so on.


Is this true? Is Quantum Cryptography obselete?

There seems to be theoretical difficulties with Kish&rsquo;s approach, but his experiments seem to suggest that he got it right.
