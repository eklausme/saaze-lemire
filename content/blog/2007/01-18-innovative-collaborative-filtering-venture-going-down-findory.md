Findory appears to have sufficient resources to run on autopilot through most of 2007. Findory will eventually fade away, but I believe it has touched immortality through the impact it had.


Apparently, Greg wants &ldquo;to spend more time on health and with family.&rdquo; Also, it is no secret that Greg was unhappy about the popularity of the site and Findory was facing the &ldquo;me too!&rdquo; routine with all the big players copying his ideas or simply creating similar tools.

I think that in the coming decade, dropping projects and reducing your work load to spend more time on your family will become a cool thing to do.

Projects and companies have to come and go. We should not be slaves to our projects.
