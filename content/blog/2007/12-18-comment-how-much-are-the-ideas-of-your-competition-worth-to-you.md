<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>I started writing a comment, but it grew so long that I moved it over here:</p>

<p>I have seen cases that the mere act of explicitly stating that &ldquo;I am working on this problem&rdquo; gives too much hint on actually solving it. The problem could be a &ldquo;currently low-hanging fruit&rdquo; to those who are up-to-date on the literature, and if one is reminded of the problem, then one can solve the problem in a matter of days or even hours. So it can degenerate into a competition on who gets a preprint on arXiv first&#8230; The lower the fruit is, the less you want to tell people.</p>
<p>Flip it around: if you are working on something high up, then even though you can tell everyone about it, you may not solve it in the end&#8230; So you don&rsquo;t want to tell people just yet so as to &ldquo;protect&rdquo; your own feelings. I think this is perfectly human.</p>
<p>What&rsquo;s left is the middle ground, which I think contains the problems that are really worth working on and it&rsquo;s also quite safe to tell everyone about it. But to identify them is very hard&#8230;</p>

<p>I often don&rsquo;t know what I&rsquo;m working on until I spend a few days implementing something that works vis a vis the concept. At that point I can usually explain what I am doing in fairly clear and simple terms. Maybe this is validation of a constructivist view of knowledge&#8230;</p>
