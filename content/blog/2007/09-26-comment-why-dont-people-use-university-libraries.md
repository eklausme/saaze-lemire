<p>I&rsquo;m currently working on earning a Master&rsquo;s degree in IT. The current academic semester has introduced me to the library resources because of the research oriented courses that I am taking. My professors have done a fairly good job of introducing the students on how to use the library resources, but somehow I felt like things weren&rsquo;t quite right. This posting explains it. It&rsquo;s most frustrating when you are able to find the abstract to an article and somehow you can&rsquo;t get the full article. </p>
<p>(Really, why do I even want to see the abstract if you can&rsquo;t provide the article? I&rsquo;m a student, I don&rsquo;t pay for articles, I pay for classes!)</p>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;ve thought about it, you&rsquo;re exactly right. I completely agree with your thoughts on this.</p>

<p>A typical scenario for me using my university library goes like this:</p>
<p>1) Find the reference using Google, CiteSeer or something that isn&rsquo;t the library search engine.</p>
<p>2) If the full paper isn&rsquo;t publicly available, access it through the university network to get the full paper.</p>
<p>3) If it&rsquo;s a physical reference, use the library search to get the call number for the next time I&rsquo;m physically there.</p>
<p>Really, the only reason I use the library is that they have access to many databases that are not open to the public. I only invoke their search when I already know what I&rsquo;m looking for.</p>

<p>I work for CISTI &#8211; Canada&rsquo;s largest science library &#8211; and I have to admit that, until recently, I followed the algorithm outlined by Geoff in his comment. But I discovered that this is not an optimal strategy, even though it is &ldquo;path of least resistance.&rdquo; In fact, if you know how to search bibliographic indexes (a big IF, and, admittedly a big hurdle for most people) your recall rates are orders of magnitude better than Google Scholar and publisher sites.</p>
<p>The good news is that libraries and librarians are acutely aware of the need to &ldquo;lower barriers to entry&rdquo;, provide Google-Scholar-like interfaces to full-text indexes, etc.</p>
<p>If you want to have a look a few ideas that we&rsquo;re experimenting with at CISTI, you can point your browser to Glen Newton&rsquo;s Ungava search / browse interface to a limited collection (NRC Press content only at the moment):</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/ungava/</a></p>
<p>It includes some interesting ways of using tag-clouds, time-line views etc. Details on what its features are can be found on the CISTI Lab Wiki:</p>
<p><a href="http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cistilabswiki/index.php/Ungava" rel="nofollow ugc">http://lab.cisti-icist.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/cistilabswiki/index.php/Ungava</a></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s very much still &ldquo;under construction&rdquo; but it will, I hope, give you the warm fuzzies that things will improve at libraries in the future.</p>
<p>I hope to have an experimental prototype article recommender system hooked up to Ungava sometime in the first quarter of 2008.</p>

<p>Believe me, librarians know all of the points you addressed in your post and many are working to make things better. </p>
<p>As for Google Scholar, I know we offer workshops to students on how to use Google better; many don&rsquo;t know you can change &lsquo;scholar preferences&rsquo; so that it does link to your library (saving that middle step of going from Google to the library website) for articles that aren&rsquo;t freely accessible.</p>
<p>Simply put, a lot of scholarly publications are still proprietary so we have to use those databases, at least until Open Access catches on in more fields.</p>
<p>I totally agree though that for some areas, there isn&rsquo;t as great a need for a physical library or librarian, but we&rsquo;re not all computer scientists or in IT.</p>
