I am not exactly sure why this would be needed, but I just want to record here that there are tools such as [latexdiff](http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/support/latexdiff/) to generate diffed out TeX or LaTeX document. Could be used by a graduate student to show &ldquo;yes, see, I have worked on my thesis.&rdquo; Another application I see is &ldquo;yes, dear editor, I have revised my paper.&rdquo; Alas, I am fearful that this may not always work. I have had bad luck using colors with some LaTeX formats.
