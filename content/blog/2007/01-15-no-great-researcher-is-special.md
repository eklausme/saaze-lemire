Peter Turney tells us that <em>there is almost no instance of a great discovery or invention that was not discovered independently and simultaneously</em>. I think it is very important to keep this in mind, given our culture of overinflated egos.

Peter then asks a very important question. If his theory is true, and he has strong backing, then why is this fact getting so little recognition?
