- It does seem like [coffee makes you smarter, even in small doses](http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs002130000506). There are several methodological issues however. The main problem is that if you are a coffee user, your brain without caffeine might be negatively impacted due to a withdrawal effect, hence giving you the illusion that caffeine helps. However, it seems that heavy coffee users still outperform before they drink coffee!
- A [moderate amount of white noise](http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/bpl/jcpp/2007/00000048/00000008/art00012), such as leaving your radio play a non-utilized frequency at a very low volume, may improve your cognitive ability by increasing your [dopamine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dopamine#Reinforcement) levels. So if you can&rsquo;t seem to focus, leaving your office for a coffee place may help. However, it you can concentrate, then white noise may decrease your already-good performance.
- [Background music may improve cognitive performance](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sites/entrez?db=pubmed&#038;uid=9450304&#038;cmd=showdetailview&#038;indexed=google). It seems listening to classical music may makes you smarter. However, [a comparison](http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&#038;cpsidt=3892105) between vocal music, instrumental music, and no music settings showed that on some tasks, no music was always better. A recent paper argues that we cannot trust many studies conducted on human beings, and that we should focus on what happens with animals. I would say that quiet instrumental music might have an effect similar to white noise, and thus, it may mostly help those who have trouble focusing. 
- [Carbohydrates may have a positive or negative impact on your cognitive ability](http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1467-3010.2007.00606.x/abstract;jsessionid=3F743E34A70786285D362E38DD99BD89.f01t01): eating sugary stuff is probably not useful. However, if you feel tensed, [protein-poor and carbohydrate-rich food may help you regain control](http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0195666397901550).
- Alcohol is probably not a good idea.


__Disclaimer__: this is not meant to be a scientific survey. However, if you disagree with my survey, please do add a comment!

__Disclaimer 2__: I drink a lot of coffee. I almost certainly reach a point where it impacts negatively my performance because I get too tense to focus. However, I find it preferable to boredom.
