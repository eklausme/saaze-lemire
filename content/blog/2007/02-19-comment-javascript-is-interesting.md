<p>Nice video, I hadn&rsquo;t watched that one. Interesting is a good word &#8211; scary perhaps. I&rsquo;m still trying to get my head around prototype based languages, and it doesn&rsquo;t help that JavaScript pretends it&rsquo;s class based&#8230;</p>

<p>I had this flagged in my RSS reader and finally got around to watching it. It is interesting, but I&rsquo;m disappointed that it&rsquo;s not said that Self did most of this kind of thing well before JavaScript. I also find it distressing that closures come across as a &ldquo;pattern&rdquo; when they strike me as a basic concept.</p>
<p>Then again, I should probably consider the target audience&#8230;</p>
