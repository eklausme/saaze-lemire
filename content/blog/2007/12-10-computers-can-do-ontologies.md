title: "Computers can do analogies"
---



Because I had read [Peter](http://www.apperceptual.com/)&lsquo;s papers, I knew that computers could solve analogies. However, seeing it with your eyes is quite impressive. TextRunner can solve analogies online (though the site is a bit slow). (Update: the site is now down.)

What does it mean? I asked it &ldquo;Quebec is to Canada what New Jersey is to ?&rdquo; and it told me &ldquo;USA.&rdquo; Right! I wonder how many human beings could get this one right?

It still failed once I made things a bit more difficult. I asked it &ldquo;a pen is to a writer what a hammer is to ?&rdquo; and then it just answered nonsense because, apparently, it does not understand (?) that a writer is a person, in this context.

Still, I had a good time.
