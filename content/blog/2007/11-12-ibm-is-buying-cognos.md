title: "IBM is buying Cognos"

IBM [buying](http://www.dbms2.com/2007/11/12/ibm-is-buying-cognos-%e2%80%93-quick-reactions/) [Cognos](http://www-01.ibm.com/software/analytics/cognos/)? (See press release.) I did not see this one coming. A few weeks ago, I heard rumors of a pan-canadian research initiative supported by Cognos. It did seem to me that Cognos was here to stay, for a very long time. Being bought by IBM, which has a lot of database technology, will probably change drastically Cognos at the R&#038;D level.

It seems that Business Intelligence (BI) is now quite mature and very integrated in the technology of large vendors (IBM, Microsoft, Oracle). 

Will there be a second wave of BI technology carried by new start-ups? I think so. And I think it will have something to do with [infinite storage](/lemire/blog/2007/03/06/wired-ap-technology-and-business-news-from-the-outside-world-on-wiredcom/). 

See my other posts [Oracle buys Hyperion](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/03/02/oracle-buys-hyperion/) and [Mondrian to partner up with Pentaho for Open Source Business Intelligence](/lemire/blog/2005/11/17/mondrian-to-partner-up-with-pentaho-for-open-source-business-intelligence/).
