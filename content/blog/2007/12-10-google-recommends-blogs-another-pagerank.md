title: "Google Recommends Blogs: Another PageRank?"
---



[Greg](https://glinden.blogspot.com/2007/12/google-reader-feed-recommendations.html), [Andre](https://synthese.wordpress.com/2007/11/30/google-blog-reader-recommender/), and many others, have written good things about the [Google Reader](https://www.google.com/reader/about/) recommender system: if you read your blogs and your news using Google Reader, Google will recommender other feeds to you based on your profile.

I have been a bit more critical. The recommender system they offer is basically flat: it seeks to offer a single top-3 list (or top-30 if you ask for more). I have been arguing for years that [recommender systems ought to be multidimensional](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/ITSE2005.html): the user should specify what type of feeds he wants at a given moment. The past and your observed habits are not always good predictors. __When you go to a store, the salesman does not immediately suggests things to you, even if he knows you well: he first finds out why you came to the store, he asks questions, he determines your context.__ For example, I am already subscribing to many Theoretical Computer Science (TCS) blogs. I do not want anymore. Yet, Google Reader assumes that because I have many TCS is my list, surely I want more. Wrong! Yet, I have no way of telling Google Reader that it is wrong, that I want something else. It could start by offering me a [tag cloud instead of a list](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_cloud) as Amazon started doing this year.

But if Google gets its recommender right, this could have far reaching consequences. According to some unconfirmed numbers, 35% of Amazon&rsquo;s sales would be due to its recommender system. Right now, 50% of all subscribers to my blog are from Google Reader. This means that, one day, 1/6th of all subscriptions to blogs could be through this recommender system! The recommender system would become part of the [blogosphere](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blogosphere) the same way the Google Ranking algorithm is part of the Web. Will it be a good thing for the blogosphere?
