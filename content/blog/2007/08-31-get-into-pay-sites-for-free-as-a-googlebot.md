title: "Get into pay sites for free as a Googlebot"

This trick is very clever: many sites limiting access to documents, let Googlebot (Google&rsquo;s spidering agent) through. I think this is the case with some IEEE archives. So, you can simply tell your browser to identify yourself as the user agent &ldquo;Googlebot/2.1&rdquo;. VoilÃ ! You can go where Google can go. What a beautiful hack!

With Firefox, you can get this result with the [User Agent Switcher](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/59).

More details are available on Pinguy&rsquo;s website.
