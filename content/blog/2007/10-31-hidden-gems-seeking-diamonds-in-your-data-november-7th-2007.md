> __Hidden Gems : seeking diamonds in your data__

Data warehouses, repositories for ever-increasing quantities of data, have become commonplace in most medium to large-sized enterprises. Finding efficient methods to explore the data for suspected and/or previously unknown information continues to be an active area of research.

We introduce the diamond cube operator which, we believe, will aid decision support and analysis. It seeks a single large dense area of data by pruning lesser attributes, i.e. they are related to few others. An algorithm has been designed, implemented and tested on a real-world, terrorism data set. Our preliminary results confirm that this operation can be used to find a dense subset within a data cube.

In this talk an overview of On-line Analytical Processing (OLAP) will be presented, together with the diamond cube operator, some of its mathematical properties and anticipated benefits to the commercial and scientific communities.
