title: "My favorite MacOS applications"
---



I made the switch to MacOS several months ago. I am now an _experienced_ Mac user.

Here are my favorite applications:

- [TextWrangler](http://www.barebones.com/products/textwrangler/). It is a free text editor that has pretty much everything you could dream off except for some nifty things like autocompletion. There is a commercial version called BBedit, but I do not know how well it supports LaTeX (autocompletion?).
- Firefox. Enough said. Try the [GrApple](http://www.takebacktheweb.org/) theme for a more integrated look and feel.
- The basic Apple applications are good enough: iTunes, Preview, Terminal, and so on. I found some of the replacements, like iTerm, to be more complicated. For example, iTerm maps the arrow keys in such a way that vi will no longer work. They are even quite open about the fact that they hacked the keyboard mapping. I can&rsquo;t have that! Leave my keyboard alone! I simply regret that Preview will not automatically reload a PDF file that has changed on disk.
- When in a bash shell, the <kbd>open</kbd> command is really very useful. Generally, you can do pretty much everything using a remote ssh shell under MacOS: mount drives, install software, and so on. I know because I do it. All the time.
- [Fink](http://finkproject.org/) is good but do not bother trying to get X11 working unless you really need to. You can get [XFig](/lemire/blog/2007/02/06/got-xfig-to-work-under-macos-with-fink/) and gnuplot to work though.
- [NeoOffice](http://www.neooffice.org/) is good. It is a good replacement for the Microsoft Office that I will not buy. However, getting MacOS to open doc files with NeoOffice is not so obvious (hint: you have to right-click on a file, then click on <em>Get Info</em>). 
- [Eclipse](http://www.eclipse.org/) works well.
