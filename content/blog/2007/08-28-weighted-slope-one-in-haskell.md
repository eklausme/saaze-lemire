Bryan [implemented](http://www.serpentine.com/blog/2007/08/27/weighted-slope-one-in-haskell-collaborative-filtering-in-29-lines-of-code/) the collaborative filtering algorithm [Weighted Slope One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One) in [Haskell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Haskell_%28programming_language%29) using only 29 lines of code. I must say, I am impressed.
