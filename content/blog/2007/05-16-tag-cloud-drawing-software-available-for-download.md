Owen made available the source code related to our recent WWW 2007 workshop paper [Tag-Cloud Drawing: Algorithms for Cloud Visualization](http://arxiv.org/abs/cs/0703109). It should run fine under MacOS and Linux. Firefox needed. There is a mix of Java code and C code. Take your pick: [lemur-tagging-0.0.zip](http://pizza.unbsj.ca/~owen/lemur-tagging-0.0.zip) or [lemur-tagging-0.0.tar.gz](http://pizza.unbsj.ca/~owen/lemur-tagging-0.0.tar.gz). This include the source code and it should run under Linux and MacOS. A port to Windows is not difficult to achieve.
