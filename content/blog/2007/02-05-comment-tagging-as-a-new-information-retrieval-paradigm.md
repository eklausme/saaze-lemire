<p>I use tags in combination with a hierarchical organization system. For example, my repository of research papers exist a single folder, with the name of the file being the paper. I find setting the name to the title is useful for the times that I search via browsing.</p>
<p>Beyond that single folder, I don&rsquo;t organize them; I use tags. The tags aren&rsquo;t meant to so much as an organizational tool so much as a useful &ldquo;search hook&rdquo;. If I need a document, I almost always search for it via Spotlight. Any tags I assign beyond the text indexing that Spotlight does are for &ldquo;meta&rdquo; terms that may not appear in the paper itself.</p>
<p>Music, photos and video clips are all managed via iTunes, where I make extensive use of the metadata. Importing can be time consuming, but it&rsquo;s worth it later on. I tried the hierarchical approach and I didn&rsquo;t care for it, mainly because I was too pedantic about making things fit together &ldquo;just right&rdquo;. I resigned myself to the &ldquo;lump it all on one place&rdquo; approach and I find I think about it a lot less.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think tags are a replacement for a folder system, but together they can be very useful.</p>

<p>I use tags to organize my files in Obsidian, a note-taking app that works as an offline wiki written in markdown.</p>
<p>For example, I have a lot of files for books I take notes from and I add metadata at the beginning of the file with author, title, tag, status (reading, to edit notes, etc). I can use a plugin that scans the metadata and allows me to build tables with a stripped-down version of SQL. I have tables for each status and tag used</p>
