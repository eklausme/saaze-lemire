<p>I agree with your post. I think alot of the misunderstanding arises because people equate software development with project management where the cardinal sin is not to meet the deadline. IMO, this should be replaced with a &ldquo;quest for value&rdquo; where software developers and other stake holders communicate regularly about whether the feature set is sufficiently rich, coherent and debugged enough to trigger it&rsquo;s roll out. It is a process that needs a certain amount of open-endedness to produce the &ldquo;value&rdquo; that all parties are ultimately &ldquo;questing&rdquo; after and will &ldquo;discover&rdquo; when the project starts to to come together. The metaphor of a &ldquo;quest&rdquo; is probably more descriptive of the software development process than the metaphor of a &ldquo;project&rdquo; governed by deadlines.</p>

<p>My comment to developers has been that if they see their job as to simply implement what&rsquo;s on the card, their job might as well go to the cheapest offshore supplier</p>
