This might be a very big deal: [Oracle just bought Hyperion for US$3.3 billion](http://www.itbusiness.ca/redirect?id=42482). The most obvious effect is that the Business Intelligence market has now fewer players then ever and Oracle is now a very serious player indeed.

I wonder what this will mean for the defunct [JOLAP](https://jcp.org/en/jsr/detail?id=69)? Could Oracle bring it back? It would be really nice to have one standard API for OLAP, even if it is limited to the Java programming language.
