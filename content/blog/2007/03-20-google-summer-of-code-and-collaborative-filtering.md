title: "Google Summer of Code and Collaborative Filtering"
---



Andre [reports](https://synthese.wordpress.com/2007/03/15/taste-in-summer-of-code/) that the Taste Collaborative Filtering library was selected by the [Google Summer of Code](https://developers.google.com/open-source/gsoc/?csw=1) program. You can check out the various summer project ideas. Among those, you have multidimensional rating algorithms: for a reference, see my [2003 paper with Harold Boley and others](https://lemire.me/fr/abstracts/COLA2003.html).

Seems like Google likes collaborative filtering. Last year, the collaborative filtering algorithm [Slope One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One) was integrated in the Drupal project.
