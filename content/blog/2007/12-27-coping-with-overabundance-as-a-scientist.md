title: "Coping with overabundance as a scientist"
---



We are in an [era of overabundance](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2007/07/13/on-overabundance-and-innovation/). Many of the problems we face &mdash; spam, information overload, obesity, pollution &mdash; are actually the result of overabundance.
Scientists need new strategies:

- Create fast, discard faster.
- Aim for quality. When people have too much content, they want quality.
- Focus and live in niches.
- Produce shorter papers. People want to learn a specific facts. Make it easy for them to find them.
- Use formats that are easy to index. Paper is terrible. Slides, voice and video are not very good. Digital text in simple formats is better.
- Make your work easy to find: nobody has time to mail order.
- Be agile: always be ready to change focus. There are just too many new opportunities!
