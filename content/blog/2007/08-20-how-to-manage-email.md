I have totally blown up the blog categories on this Web site. Sorry, I can&rsquo;t maintain a taxonomy on the long run. To me, a taxonomy is useful as a screen shot of your mind. But it is not a valid, long term, knowledge management system. I will never sort emails or blog posts into folders ever again. The era where we tried to copy the paper folders in the digital world is over. Digital knowledge management is finally here, and this video by Merlin Mann is an important piece in training you to it.
