title: "Is PageRank just good marketing?"
---



Web search engines such as Google look at which page links to which page to determine what are the authoritative Web pages. A good algorithm in this context is one that is hard to fool: if you and your friends decide to mutually add link to each others, it should be hard to make much of a difference. Sérgio [commented](/lemire/blog/2007/11/27/why-bother-with-google-go-straight-to-wikipedia/#comments) earlier on this blog that PageRank is known to be just a marketing. So I decided to go hunting. Up until now, I thought PageRank was a clever idea because it feels like it would be harder to fool it than just counting how many in-bound link a page has. It was not very long before I found a reference that supported Sérgio&rsquo;s claim:

>Log of indegree was highly correlated with Google-reported PageRank scores, and just as effective when predicting desirable company attributes. Further, we found that PageRank scores for sites within a known spam network were no lower than would be expected on the basis of their indegree. We encounter no compelling evidence to support the use of PageRank over indegree.

Anyone knows of any demonstrated benefit of PageRank over merely counting the number of inbound links? Is PageRank more resilient at all?

__Update__: do read the comments! They are more interesting than my post.
