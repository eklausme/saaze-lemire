It seems [multivitamins can increase your chances of getting cancer](http://www.radio-canada.ca/nouvelles/Science-Sante/2007/05/16/003-cancer-prostate-.shtml). Vitamins A and E, folic acid can be [dangerous](http://www.nytimes.com/2003/04/29/science/vitamins-more-may-be-too-many.html). It seems that the problem stems from excessive dosage. A very moderate use of multivitamins is probably not dangerous.
