It looks like [Value Investing News](http://www.valueinvestingnews.com/content-recommendations-upgrade) has turned to [Slope One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One) for its recommender system. Here are the features they support:

- You can spot the recommendations engine in action when you click on the Recommendations tab at the top of the page.
- You can also find it in action when you click on other user&rsquo;s names, such as George. The top of the right hand column will show you a list of Recommended Users.
- Finally, you can find a list of users that liked a particular article by clicking on the Full story links. At the bottom of the each story link discussion you will find a Those that like this also liked section.
