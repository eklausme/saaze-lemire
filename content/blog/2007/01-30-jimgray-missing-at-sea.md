Well-known in Silicon Valley database software circles, Gray was awarded the prestigious A.M. Turing Award &#8212; the so-called &ldquo;Nobel Prize of computer science&rdquo; &#8212; in 1998 for his body of work, which helped paved the way for automatic-teller machines, computerized airline reservations and e-commerce.

Over the years, he moved from jobs at IBM, Tandem Computers and DEC, and, eventually, to Microsoft in 1995. And he became an avid sailor, often heading out alone.
