<p>Thanks for the post ! </p>
<p>I installed and used TaskFreak all the day and got my best day since a while&#8230; But it was frustrating to not be able to conetxtualize the tasks and the report a little bit more. GTD-PHP do that perfectly&#8230; </p>
<p>Moreover, even if it&rsquo;s not documented on their website, it&rsquo;s pretty easy to installed on Windows IIS + MySQL. It took me 2-3 minutes&#8230; </p>
<p>Thanks again !</p>
