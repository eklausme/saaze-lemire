title: "Why having a readership matters"
---



I recently proposed that scientists should adopt the [find a readership or perish](/lemire/blog/2007/12/03/find-a-readership-or-perish/) motto. (A related goal for engineers might be &ldquo;find users or perish.&rdquo;) The goal is certainly not to have as many readers as possible, but having some serious readers matter.

I was chatting with [Seb Paquet today](http://radio-weblogs.com/0110772/) and he came up with a good argument to support this view: it is very hard to have a significant readership without serving a useful function in a community. __In other words, it is easier to write many empty/wrong papers than it is to attract a large readership with empty/wrong papers.__
