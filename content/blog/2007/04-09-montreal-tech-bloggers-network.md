Somehow I appear on the (new) Montreal Tech Bloggers Network. I am flattered to be on the same list as [Austin Hill](http://www.hugedomains.com/domain_profile.cfm?d=billionswithzeroknowledge&amp;e=com).

I am generally terrible at networking outside the Internet. It is not so much that I am totally socially inept, but I hate unwanted disruptions. So I am not sure I belong to any Montreal network. But I won&rsquo;t complain if people think I do contribute to the Montreal Tech blog community.
