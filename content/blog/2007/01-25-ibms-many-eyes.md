IBM has an impressive Web 2.0 project called [Many Eyes](http://www.ibm.com/us-en/) where you come in, upload your data and choose a visualization. The visualizations are based on Java applets and are pretty dynamic: you can drill-down and search the data visually. What is impressive is that it is totally open. You can upload __your__ data, people can then work on your data and discover new ways to do it.

Many Eyes is a bet on the power of human visual intelligence to find patterns. Our goal is to &ldquo;democratize&rdquo; visualization and to enable a new social kind of data analysis.


This is human-driven collaborative data mining. I like it. I think this type of research has a bright future.

Imagine researchers making available their data and asking people to play with it?
