<p><i>It encourages overly large groups</i></p>
<p>On the other hand, there are many situations in which multi-author papers are counted less than single-author ones. This has been cited as an impediment for interdisciplinary collaboration.</p>
<p>Perhaps this evaluation of research is like <i>Consumer Reports</i> evaluating chocolate (which they&rsquo;ve done): it&rsquo;s relatively straightforward to recognize crap, but after that it really depends on the consumer. This is excepting the Nobel, Fields, and Turing level stuff, which it&rsquo;s likely won&rsquo;t be recognized until after the publication in question is no longer relevant for evaluation purposes (at least, that&rsquo;s what I keep telling myself).</p>

<p>Michael, for your reference:</p>
<p>When Parnas refers to overly large groups, he explains &ldquo;Academics with large groups who spend little time with each student, but put their name on all of their students&rsquo; papers, will rank above those who work intensively with a few students.&rdquo;</p>
