This is great fun. [Taporware: prototype of text analysis tools](http://taporware.mcmaster.ca/). Their &ldquo;about&rdquo; page is probably slightly obselete, but the gist of it is there:

> TAPoRware is a set of text analysis tools that enables users to perform text analysis on HTML, XML and plain text files, using documents from the users&rsquo; machine or on the web. The TAPoRware tools were developed with support from the Canada Foundation for Innovation and the McMaster University Faculty of Humanities. These tools are being developed by Geoffrey Rockwell, Lian Yan, Andrew Macdonald and Matt Patey of the TAPoR Project for a TAPoR Portal which we expect to open in 2005.
