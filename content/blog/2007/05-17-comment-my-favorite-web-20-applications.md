<p>I agree with the analysis and I think that more and more Web 2.0 applications will boom soon. I would like to invite to try g.ho.st at <a href="http://g.ho.st" rel="nofollow ugc">http://g.ho.st</a> the global hosted operating system which bring a common desktop, file system and sign-in to the Web 2.0 applications.</p>
<p>Thanks<br/>

<p>Thanks for dropping so web2.0 sites, I really enjoyed seeing swivel (somehow I missed that one in my web travels).</p>
<p>I am in complete agreement with you on the web as a platform thing. Interesting though, your comment about dropping C++ or Fortran for running on the web. That&rsquo;s actually kind of a neat idea. There is already a psuedo ruby environment on the web, of course it is a tutorial program, and most likely doesn&rsquo;t really let you &ldquo;run&rdquo; ruby in the browser, but you saying it just might make someone go do it. I would try to make it work if I had the time.</p>
<p>As to the drawing and gaming, I really think it is just a matter of the browser software doing better at handling more graphically random or complex things. </p>
<p>I made the decision to go into Business Computer systems instead of CS when I started college, and I have to say that it has really paid off for me. I would agree that web applications these days are as much design as programming however, I think that &ldquo;designers&rdquo; could stand to learn as much about interface design as some highly skilled programmers. </p>
<p>The reality is, that the farther the computer world progresses, the more discipline crossover happens. It&rsquo;s no longer strictly programming or business, or art or science. It seems like you have to know a bit of everything to be successful.</p>
