<p>Daniel, I am in the same boat as you. My trusty M500 is still going strong for now (except for a few times when all the info on it disappeared), but I&rsquo;m afraid that if I don&rsquo;t upgrade soon, Palm is going to go out of business and I will be stuck with trying to transfer my Palm-based data to another format. Unfortunately, I haven&rsquo;t found another Palm-based solution outside of the ones from Palm, so it looks like our choices are very limited.</p>
