title: "My philosophical interests"

My friend Dan recently asked me what philosophical questions interested me. Here is my answer.

What is knowledge, what is information? Can knowledge be captured and represented formally? Why is English (or other languages) not evolving<br/>
toward greater formalism, but rather evolving toward greater flexibility, fluidity?

Are we living inside a Turing machine?

How do you know that a duck is a duck? Do you have mentally a formal definition that you apply? Do you check successively for some characteristics, applying some kind of algorithm? If you do apply an algorithm, does it terminate? That is, do you ever know for sure it is a duck?
