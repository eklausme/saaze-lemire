title: "Computing the Hamming distance between two strings in Java?"
---



Odd. I was looking this morning for some Java code to compute the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) between any two strings in Java, and could not find it. There are plenty of code samples for the Hamming distance between integers, but I am really looking for something that can process String objects.

Anyone knows where I could find this?

__Update__. Yes, I know it is not difficult. I am _really_ looking for a Java two-liner.
