title: "Technorati: Only 45 People"
---



Technorati is one of the few long standing Internet companies to be in the search business and to stand tall in front of Google and Yahoo. And there are only 45 of them. That is not exactly a basement operation, but given how well established the company is, that is a very small number.

What does it say about the future of Information Technology? Are all the mail servers in the world be run by 30 people one day?
