title: "Human Brain Evolution Slows To A Crawl"

According to Chung-I Wu from the University of Chicago [the human brain hardly evolves anymore](http://www.scienceagogo.com/news/20070001205947data_trunc_sys.shtml).

> The researchers say the slowdown may be due to the increasingly complexity of interactions within the brain. &ldquo;We know that proteins with more interacting partners evolve more slowly,&rdquo; Wu said. &ldquo;Mutations that disrupt existing interactions aren&rsquo;t tolerated. On the basis of individual neurons of the brain, humans may indeed have a far more active, or even more complex, transcription profile than chimpanzee. We suggest that such abundant and complex transcription may increase gene-gene interactions and constrain coding-sequence evolution.


Any mathematician worth its salt will think about an iterative algorithm reaching a local maximum and no longer able to improve the solution by much. Are human beings a local maximum of evolution?

What is interesting also is that chimps are now evolving faster than we do. This feels like a [David Brin](http://www.davidbrin.com/) novel!
