title: "Google Summer of Code &ndash; Collaborative Filtering"
---



[Andre](http://web.ncf.ca/an386/) sent me a link to the projects that will be supported by Google for the Summer of Code. The Collaborative Filtering library [Taste](http://taste.sourceforge.net/) will get two developers over the summer. That&rsquo;s pretty good.

I wonder why IBM, which is 100 times richer than Google, never thought of supporting Summer of code initiatives. Take off your ties people and think outside the box a little!
