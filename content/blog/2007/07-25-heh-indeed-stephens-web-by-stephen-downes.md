[Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=41040) cites Tom Hoffman:

> A lot of IT infrastructure is fragile rickety crap, and the people responsible for it aren&rsquo;t smart enough to fix it so they make rules and place blame based on little more than superstition.


You think this is false? Recently, Monday in fact, I asked a copy editor to install Open Office so that she could open the Open Document Format files I was sending her. The answer? The IT people say that Open Office is incompatible with Microsoft Office so it cannot be installed. Total nonsense, but the users buy this. Beautiful. IT people aren&rsquo;t smart enough. The perfect way to become obsolete fast.
