title: "Why wonÂ´t to-do applications use mind maps?"
---



I have been using [taskfreak](http://www.taskfreak.com/) to manage my to-do lists. It works well. However, it fails to provide a good visualization of what I have to do. I love lists, but lists work better when they are short and my to-do lists are always very long. [Mind maps](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind_map) are far better to visualize complex data.

Why won&rsquo;t taskfreak and related tools automatically generate mind maps?
