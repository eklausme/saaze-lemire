<p>I&rsquo;m seeking another strategy for information overload: damping the effect of information noise by reducing your sampling interval, that is, the frequency in which you check out RSS feeds, email etc. More thoughts at <a href="http://blog.isnotworking.com/2007/12/reducing-day-to-day-information-noise.html" rel="nofollow ugc">http://blog.isnotworking.com/2007/12/reducing-day-to-day-information-noise.html</a></p>

<p>There&rsquo;s that old saying which often comes to my mind, &ldquo;Speak only if you can improve upon the silence&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Every time you speak, every time you write, your are making a demand on the receivers of your message. You are asking for some of their most valuable resources &#8211; time and attention.</p>
<p>I think information producers (authors, etc.) ought to feel they have a responsibility to ensure that their production will be seen by people who are interested in it *and* not pushed in front of people who have no interest in it.</p>
<p>Concretely, this means ensuring your stuff is smartly summarized, indexed, tagged, searchable, and richly &amp; meaningfully interconnected with genuinely related stuff (be it written by yourself or others). </p>
<p>Ideally there shouldn&rsquo;t be a lot of redundance between the various pieces of your output &#8211; I&rsquo;ve run into sets of papers that could easily each have been split into smaller chunks that are reused across papers, saving everyone time.</p>
<p>Just making the effort to write in a concise but accessible style could really help people figure out quickly if they want to dig into what you&rsquo;ve written.</p>
<p>The work of connecting pieces of information/knowledge together where the connection is meaningful and hasn&rsquo;t been made before is valuable.</p>
<p>People need to act as public filters as much as possible. The sifting is tremendously improved (the noise level goes way down) once you can rely on a network of trusted filters.</p>
<p>Efforts at connecting and filtering are rewarded more nowadays, thanks to weblogs &amp; co., but there is still a long way to go.</p>
