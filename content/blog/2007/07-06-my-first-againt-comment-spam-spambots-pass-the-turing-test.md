title: "My Fight Againt Comment SPAM: Spambots pass the Turing test!"
---



Ok. I&rsquo;ve had it. Either the [spambots](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spambot) pass the [Turing test](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_test) and have achieved [strong AI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_AI), or there is an army (a very large one) of folks paid to spam blogs.

Anyone who has posted a comment on my blog in the last few months knows it requires at least one full second, preferably two or three, to pass my [captcha](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Capcha). Currently, you have to be able to do arithmetic with roman numerals. Not exactly Ph.D. worthy, but still a bit of a challenge. For all sorts of reasons, including accessibility, I have given up on image-based captchas. My captchas are customized and modified regularly, and usually involve that you read a piece of text and translate it into an arithmetic problem. Some human beings have complained that they had to give up posting a comment because the problem was too hard. If you took a snapshot of my system, you could easily build a computer program to pass my captchas, but because I change them all the time, and because they only appear on my low-traffic site, I figure that nobody would ever bother trying.

Well, I still get about 3 spam comments per day. No matter what. There is a spam-free delay of a week or so after I change drastically the captcha, but spam quickly resumes.

Ok, it could be that a spambot was programmed to beat the general type of captchas I use. Still, it is pretty impressive the way I get spammed with such efficiency.

The fact that I am nearly convinced that I deal with human beings, tell you that if I, in fact, have to deal with machines, these machines pass a Turing test with flying colors.

I am now waiting to see how long it will take for the spambots to learn roman numerals. If they do so in less than a week, I will seriously worry about my safety.
