I have now officially moved from [taskfreak](http://www.taskfreak.com/) to [gtd-php](http://www.gtd-php.com/). Taskfreak is prettier, it is faster (in part due to its use of AJAX), and supports multiusers.

However, gtd-php is far more [GTD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GTD) compliant. For one thing, with taskfreak, I continually felt overwhelmed since all of your tasks are visible all the time. [gtd-php](http://www.gtd-php.com/) is much better at showing you just what you need, when you need it.

Now, if only it was faster!

To learn more about GTD, watch this:
