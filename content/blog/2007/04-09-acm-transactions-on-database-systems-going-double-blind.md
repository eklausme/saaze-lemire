title: "ACM Transactions on Database Systems going double blind"
---



[Richard T. Snodgrass](http://www.cs.arizona.edu/~rts/), the editor-in-chief of ACM Transactions on Database Systems wrote a beautiful [editorial](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1206049.1206050&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM&amp;idx=1206049&amp;part=periodical&amp;WantType=periodical&amp;title=ACM%2520Transactions%2520on%2520Database%2520Systems%2520%2528TODS%2529) (ACM TODS, Volume 32, Issue 1, March 2007) explaining why they just changed the journal to use a double-blind review system, that is, a review system where authors do not know who reviews them and the reviewers do not know who they review. This system is far from perfect, but I much prefer symmetry. Either everyone sees everyone, or else, everyone goes blind. Here is a quote that&rsquo;s good summary:

>  Many studies provide evidence that DBR (double-blind review) is more fair to authors from less prestigious institutions and to women authors. Such differences are likely to matter even more for highly selective conferences and journals.
