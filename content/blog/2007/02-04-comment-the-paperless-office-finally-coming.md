<blockquote><p>Reading a document on your screen is really difficult when you have 640 by 480 pixels on a 14 inches monitor, but it becomes considerably easier on a 2500 by 1200 pixels 30 inches screen.</p></blockquote>
<p>However, a 30-inch high-res monitor is not exactly a very portable medium. What makes a big difference between monitor and a piece/stack/pile of paper is that the latter can be pretty much taken anywhere, folded or made more compact in a number of other ways.</p>
<p>It won&rsquo;t be till our screens bolster at least 300dpi resolution and are compact enough to fit in a small briefcase, that the paperless becomes a reality.</p>

<p>Linux doesn&rsquo;t support full-text indexing? Have you ever heard of Beagle?</p>

<p>Text indexing is not a very hard thing to do. I&rsquo;m pretty sure there are several available for Linux (like the aforementioned Beagle).</p>

<p>You mention that you would like to click a reference and download it automatically, which PDF and Word formats both allow.</p>
<p>One of the larger issues here is that people are NOT taking advantage of the tools already in place.</p>
