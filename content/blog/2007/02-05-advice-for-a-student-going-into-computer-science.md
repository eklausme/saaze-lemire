title: "Advice for a student going into Computer Science"
---



I was recently asked what kind of advice I would give to someone who wants to study Computer Science. Where to go, what to study? The best article on the matter, at least the best I ever saw, is [Undergraduation](http://www.paulgraham.com/college.html) by Paul Graham.

Here is an amusing quote:

> The social sciences are also fairly bogus, because they&rsquo;re so much influenced by intellectual fashions. If a physicist met a colleague from 100 years ago, he could teach him some new things; if a psychologist met a colleague from 100 years ago, they&rsquo;d just get into an ideological argument.

Or this one&hellip;

> Another way to figure out which fields are worth studying is to create the dropout graph. For example, I know many people who switched from math to computer science because they found math too hard, and no one who did the opposite. People don&rsquo;t do hard things gratuitously; no one will work on a harder problem unless it is proportionately (or at least log(n)) more rewarding. So probably math is more worth studying than computer science.
