title: "Duck Typing, MustIgnore and the Web"
---



Thanks in part to a private email from [Stephen Downes](http://www.downes.ca), who seems to have enjoyed my post on [Duck Typing and AI](/lemire/blog/2007/01/27/duck-typing-artificial-intelligence-and-philosophy/), I now see that 

- the [MustIgnore principle](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2006/01/09/On-XML-Language-Design) in XML, 
- the Web mantra <em>Be strict in what you send, generous in what you accept</em>,
- and duck typing


are the __same idea__. A very important idea indeed.

More later on this.
