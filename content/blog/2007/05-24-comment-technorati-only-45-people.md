<p>I would say more. In a (not so unlikely) future, we could have all our mail server and web server run by one corporation.<br/>
Just imagine if tomorrow Google will say: &ldquo;we can host your web site for free, and you can register a URL with us for free as well&rdquo;. Basically a lot of people will say &ldquo;why not? Better reliability, no more time in administering machines, forever backups, fast web site, &#8230;&rdquo;. And then all Web sites will be hosted on Google machines, so there will be just one, big, global Web server. Technically they are already able to do it.<br/>
The same argument applies for emails of course.<br/>
This is a scary (but not too impossible) future.</p>
