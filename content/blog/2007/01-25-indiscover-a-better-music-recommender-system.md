title: "inDiscover &ndash; a better music recommender system"
---



There is a new version of our music recommender system out: <a href="http://www.indiscover.net/" title="Helping artists get heard, and others to discover independent music">inDiscover</a>. I actually did not play any role in the new release, but I must say this is a good revision of the site. I only regret the huge and annoying ads.

The music content is good and free. The rating system is easy to use and the recommender works.

 If I&rsquo;m not mistaken they went from LAMP (Linux, Apache, MySQL, PHP) to C# and SQL Server. I think also that the site uses AJAX, and many limitations of the previous site were lifted,<del> but alas, it looks like support for RSS feeds has gone out the window</del> (__Update__: RSS feeds are still very much there).

My congratulations to [Sean](https://myspace.com/mcgraths) and the whole team.
