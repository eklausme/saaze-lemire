I have been looking for a written-down version of this deep-sounding quote from my favorite TV show (Battlestar Galactica) ever since I heard it, and I finally found it, on IMDB. It was uttered in the episode [Resurrection Ship: Part 2](https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0519782/quotes) in 2006. Here it is:

>__Lt. Sharon &lsquo;Boomer&rsquo; Valerii__: <em>[Adama asks Sharon why the Cylons hate humanity so much]</em> I don&rsquo;t know if &lsquo;hate&rsquo; is the right word&hellip; it&rsquo;s like you said at the ceremony&hellip; you said something that sounded like it wasn&rsquo;t the speech you had prepared. You said, &lsquo;Man never asked itself why it should survive.&rsquo; Maybe you don&rsquo;t.



Context: the cylons, these advanced AI machines initially created by man, wiped out humanity without any apparent reason.
