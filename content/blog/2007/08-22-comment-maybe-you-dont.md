<p>Though I haven&rsquo;t found many people that share this opinion, I think the re-imagined BSG Series is by far one of the best shows on television right now. This is one of many deep-sounding quotes from a show that really makes you think.</p>
<p>To be picky, I believe IMDB is wrong, and the quote was said by &ldquo;Athena&rdquo; (though she may not have been given the callsign at this stage in the series).</p>
