[Kasparov](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kasparov) is arguably the greatest chess player in history. It takes a man with a healthy brain, lots of memory, and an incredible determination, to achieve such a mythical status.

Unfortunately for Putin&rsquo;s government, Kasparov is their opponent. Here is [what Kasparov](http://www.opinionjournal.com/extra/?id=110010398) suggests we do to understand Putin:

> If you are in a real hurry to become an expert on the Russian government, you may prefer the DVD section, where you can find Mr. Puzo&rsquo;s works on film. &ldquo;The Godfather&rdquo; trilogy is a good place to start, but do not leave out &ldquo;The Last Don,&rdquo; &ldquo;Omerta&rdquo; and &ldquo;The Sicilian.&rdquo;


Of all people, I think Kasparov is one of the few the Russian government will not touch. Or, at least, I hope this is true.
