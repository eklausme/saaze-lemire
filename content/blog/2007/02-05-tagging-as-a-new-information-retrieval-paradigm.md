title: "Tagging as a new information retrieval paradigm"

The Sydney Morning Herarld is reporting that [Tagging is popular](http://www.smh.com.au/news/web/tagging-becoming-more-popular/2007/02/01/1169919452249.html). [Tags](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tag_%28metadata%29) are a Web 2.0 feature popularized by the Canadian Web site [Flickr](https://www.flickr.com/) (possibly the largest and most popular multimedia database even built, before youtube came along). Essentially, tags allow us to replace semantically __rigid__ taxonomies with more workable labels. These labels may be part of a hierarchy (<em>java</em> would be part of <em>programming</em>), but these hierarchies are typically never written down anywhere. When using tags, a given object will typically receive many tags, unlike taxonomies where we often try to have mutually exclusive categories. I like to think of tags as multidimensional, collaborative, and personalized taxonomies.

According to a recent survey, 28 percent of internet users have tagged content, and 7 percent have done so on a typical day. The number is maybe not surprising if you consider that youtube, flickr, del.icio.us, and so on, are very popular sites. 

What I want to know is how many people actually use these tags for Information Retrieval?

Well, I just realized recently that Google Mail is tag-based (its &ldquo;labels&rdquo; are nothing but tags!). So all Google Mail heavy users are tag users. However, I use maybe only 10 labels, most others are never used and recently, Google took away all tags I had not used in a long time (which was a relief!). I have used tags more actively while preparing a conference, to categorize the various emails (paperunderreview, answerfromreviewer, and so on), but again, there were very few tags.

Also, whereas the posts on my blog used to belong to a taxonomy, increasingly, things are &ldquo;degrading&rdquo; (gracefully) into a tagging system (the hierarchies a getting less useful over time). However, the tagging is mostly used by me to help my readers find other posts they might like. I actually never use the tags to find my way on my blog. I have no idea whether users actually use these tags. I doubt it.

Slashdot started using tags recently, but I am not sure whether they will prove useful. I certainly never use them.

I still think that tags go in the right direction, generally speaking. But I am not sure we have the right recipe yet, but I could be wrong.

Already, you can find a tag cloud on my site, but it uses automatically parsed content. Look for it if you are interested. No, it does not appear on the front page. In fact, I find that most sites do not offer their bird&rsquo;s eye view of the tags. You typically have to look for it. If tags were used often, wouldn&rsquo;t they be easier to find?

What about you? Do you use tags? Do you find them useful?
