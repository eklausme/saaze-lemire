title: "Optical disks, soon to be obsolete?"

I will make a prediction. Optical disks, such as [DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DVD), [HD-DVDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-DVD), [Blu-Rays](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc), and so on, will not matter in five years. And no, [tape will not replace them](/lemire/blog/2007/10/03/tape-as-the-future-of-storage-are-sun-and-dell-insulting-our-intelligence/).

I see only one viable storage technology in five years: fast volatile memory hooked up to a super-fast network.

Why will it happen? One word: youtube. Unavoidably, video-on-the-Web will get better resolution, you will have longer streams, and it will only get more popular.

How are we going to make this happen? Fiber in every house?

Meanwhile, Sony and Microsoft are fighting over which format will dominate the market ([HD-DVD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/HD-DVD) or [Blu-Ray](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blu-ray_Disc)). I say neither.
