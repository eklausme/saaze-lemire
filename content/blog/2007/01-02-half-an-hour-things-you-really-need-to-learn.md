Stephen Downes&rsquo; [Things You Really Need to Learn](https://halfanhour.blogspot.com/2006/08/things-you-really-need-to-learn.html) is a good read. Here are some good bits:

> It is perhaps cynical to say that society is a giant conspiracy to get you to feel badly about yourself, but it wouldn&rsquo;t be completely inaccurate either. Advertisers make you feel badly so you&rsquo;ll buy their product, politicians make you feel incapable so you&rsquo;ll depend on their policies and programs, even your friends and acquaintances may seek to make you doubt yourself in order to seek an edge in a competition. (&hellip;) So you have to take charge of your own sense of self-worth.


> Living meaningfully is actually a combination of several things. It is, in one sense, your dedication to some purpose or goal. But it is also your sense of appreciation and dedication to the here and now. And finally, it is the realization that your place in the world, your meaningfulness, is something you must create for yourself.
