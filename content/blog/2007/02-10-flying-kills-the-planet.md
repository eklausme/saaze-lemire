[Tim has been told that all this travel he does is not environmentally friendly](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2007/02/10/Enviro). That&rsquo;s right. Planes kill the planet. A single round-trip Montreal-Los Angeles emits 1 ton of CO<sub>2</sub>. Compare this with the fact that the average Canadian emits 18 tons of dioxide.

Anyone who flies more often than 30 times a year is very likely an evil, tree hater, child molester.

This includes a large fraction of the research community.

Which is exactly why I never bring my kids to the office.
