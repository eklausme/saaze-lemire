<p>Hi Daniel,<br/>
Fire-i camera has not been discontinued, it is just temporarily out of stock.<br/>
That is because of excessive demand from Apple users (because of iSight being discontinue since September, in Europe especially).</p>
<p>Our sales will re-launch by mid to end February and we will introduce some minor improvements in packaging, the lens system etc. </p>
<p>Still no built-in sound though as this was a proprietary technology from Apple and we want our camera to comply with the IIDC (as it is called) standard for firewire cameras.</p>
<p>Kind Regards,<br/>

<p>Hi Daniel, </p>
<p>im not writing about a camera, but i thought you might be interested in our website. </p>
<p>Once your webcam connected, you can instantly record and publish video and audio. </p>
<p>We are working on making the video quality better, but otherwise, there is no software to install, no video to upload. Less than 5 clicks ðŸ˜‰</p>
