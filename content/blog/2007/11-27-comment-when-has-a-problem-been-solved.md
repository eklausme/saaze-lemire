<p>Some notes:</p>
<p> &#8211; I&rsquo;d give a Nobel Prize to anyone who could reduce global warming/decrease cancer rates/improve worldwide health by 1%.</p>
<p>&#8211; Spam will always have a precision/recall tradeoff, I think. I can stop your FP rate by blocking your access to mail.</p>
<p>&#8211; Spammers will continue to improve, so an &lsquo;order of magnitude&rsquo; improvement might just be to stay at a current annoyance level. </p>
<p>&#8211; The definition of &lsquo;spam&rsquo; will always fuzzy, as well. </p>
<p>&#8211; I dislike your spam protection ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>I like Daniel&rsquo;s high level perspective: researchers should focus on work that has room to have a big effect. Once we get down to the minor details it&rsquo;s hard for researchers to have much of an impact, because the actual environment in which the research is deployed may matter more than the algorithm/interface/whatever discovered by the researcher.</p>
<p>OTOH, I&rsquo;m not sure there&rsquo;s a &ldquo;order of magnitude&rdquo; definition that we&rsquo;re all going to agree to. I think it&rsquo;s very dependent on the domain, and the needs of users within that domain. To me the key question is: will this research, if it succeeds, change the user experience in a qualitative way? If so, I&rsquo;m interested; if not, less so.</p>
