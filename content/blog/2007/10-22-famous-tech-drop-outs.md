I decided it to update my list of famous tech drop-outs.

[Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) &#8211; Facebook<br/>
[Bill Gates](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_gates) &#8211; Microsoft<br/>
[Steve Jobs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steve_Jobs) &#8211; Apple<br/>
[Michael Dell](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Dell) &#8211; Dell<br/>
[Larry Ellison](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Ellison) &#8211; Oracle<br/>
[Mike Lazaridis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mike_Lazaridis) &#8211; Blackberry<br/>
[Shawn Fanning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shawn_Fanning) &#8211; Napster<br/>
[Blake Ross](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blake_Ross) &#8211; Firefox

I am sure you can help me complete my list. (Note: I think a better list would be &ldquo;people without a college degree who made it big in tech.&rdquo;)

See also my preceding article Where would we be without school drop outs?

__Update__: I do not mean to imply that there is a causal relation between dropping out of college and making it big.
