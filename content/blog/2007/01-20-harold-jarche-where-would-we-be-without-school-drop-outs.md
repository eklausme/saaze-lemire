[Harold ](http://jarche.com/2007/01/where-would-we-be-without-school-drop-outs/) reminds us that school dropouts are can achieve great things:

> Bill Gates &#8211; Microsoft<br/>
Steve Jobs &#8211; Apple<br/>
Michael Dell &#8211; Dell<br/>
Larry Ellison &#8211; Oracle<br/>
Mike Lazaridis &#8211; Blackberry<br/>
Shawn Fanning &#8211; Napster


Repeatedly, when I bring this argument about to explain why I think a full college education is far from a necessary thing, people tell me that these people are special cases. Are they really? Or are they the most famous ones?

I think there is a reason why greatness and dropouts go well together. People who don&rsquo;t fit the mold are more likely to go out and break molds later on&hellip; and trying to fit is the best way to be &ldquo;average.&rdquo;

Myself, though I have a Ph.D. and other degrees, from good schools, I will not push, in any way, my sons to go get a college education. There are far better things a 20 years old can do rather than sit on a bench listening to a college professor. Oh! You have to listen to the smart folks, but if you don&rsquo;t go out and build things, it is all for naught.
