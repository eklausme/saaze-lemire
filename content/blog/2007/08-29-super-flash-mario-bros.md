My wife loved this: [Super Flash Mario Bros](http://super-flash-mario-bros.freeonlinegames.com/). Flash games can really be impressive. This one looks and feels very much like the Nintendo original.

Me? I could never figure out the appeal of a game like Mario. Somehow, I always end up falling into nothingness well before the first level is over. Where do all these Marios end up after falling for a long time? Wouldn&rsquo;t the hole eventually fill up with corpses? What about the smell? Or are we supposed to assume that the hole has infinite depth? But can gravity and holes of infinite depth mix? Wouldn&rsquo;t this be very unstable? Wouldn&rsquo;t the dirt keep on falling in these holes? What does he eat? Turtles maybe? Uncooked turtles?
