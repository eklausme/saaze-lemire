title: "Death to the 3-hour exam"
---



As an undergraduate student, I hated the 3-hour exams. But I knew how to do well on them. The secret? Get your hands on all exams from the last ten years for this class. Sit down for a couple of days and grind through all questions. It works because a 3-hour exam is a very specific context.
But wait&hellip; as a professor, why would I care about how my students do on a 3-hour exam? Does it measure what I care about? Jon Dron said it best: &ldquo;<em>So, I have been thinking about what exams taught me:(&hellip;) that the most important things in life generally take around three hours to complete</em>.&rdquo;

We need novelists, NASA engineers, and researchers. People who can work for days, weeks, months, on the same project. What I want from my students is an ability to sit down for hours and days, and work out difficult problems. I see no evidence that training specifically for exams is the right type of training.

What are the alternatives? At the University of Toronto, we only had take-home exams in higher Mathematics classes. The problems were difficult, but satisfying. What about cheating? I will do whatever I can in my classes to prevent cheating, however my primary function cannot be to thwart cheaters.
(Starting in September 2009, I am switching all my classes to take-home exams.)
