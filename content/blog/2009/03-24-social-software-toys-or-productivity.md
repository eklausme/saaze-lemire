title: "Social Software&#8230; toys or productivity?"
---



A colleague of mine, Sébastien Paquet, wrote his Computer Science Ph.D. thesis on the benefits of social software for scientists. Sébastien determined through [self-experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation) that using social software could improve substantially your network as a scientist. After years as a blogger, I can testify that blogging did improve substantially my network. I also believe it made me a better writer.

- __Better networking__: [My list of readers](/lemire/blog/my-readers/) shows that I am read by a wide range of people, from famous scientists to entrepreneurs. Considering that, as a scientist, I rarely attend conferences or participate in large-scale projects, I am vastly more connected than I should be.
- __Better writing__: When I write research papers or lecture notes, writing well is important, even essential, but the focus is on the scientific results. I find that blogging forces me to focus on writing better. Not to mention that some people criticize my writing publicly: that is a strong incentive to get better!


Secondary benefits include better knowledge management: often I can&rsquo;t remember something, but I remember writing about it on my blog! However, I find that I am spending more and more time on sites such as [facebook](https://www.facebook.com/profile.php?id=633613255&amp;ref=profile), [friendfeed](http://blog.friendfeed.com/) and [twitter](https://twitter.com/lemire). I am slightly worried that these sites may have lesser benefits for scientists.

- __No better writing__: Most of the social software sites require little prose. A lot of the interaction involves no writing at all! And the writting is simply not sophisticated enough to require much effort.
- __No better networking__: It is much harder to build long-lasting content on these social sites. Many of the 1000+ subscribers to my blog subscribed because they found at least one blog post interesting. On facebook, I am only a stream of slightly incoherent bits of news.


__Conclusion__: I will not give up on this blog in the near future, no matter how good twitter or facebook get.
