title: "What is more fundamental: Physics or Computer Science?"
---



Computer Science can be taken a natural science: the study of how the universe processes information. If it is a natural science, then does it build on Physics? Or does Physics build on Computer Science?

The answer is obvious (to me): Without algorithms there would be no Physics! Physics is built on the fundamental assumption that we can model the world using algorithms. __Computer Science is the most fundamental natural science.__

Of course, it does! Take the [strong Church-Turing thesis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church%E2%80%93Turing_thesis): the assumption that the universe is a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine). It has deep implications:

1. There is no problem solvable by a human brain that cannot be solved by a machine. In particular, creativity and intuition are computable. Philosophically, we have no soul (not anymore than a PC).
1. We all live within a discrete computer simulation. [Physics is digital](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_physics). Continuous functions (such as <em>f</em>(<em>x</em>)=sin(<em>x</em>)) are approximations to the discrete functions governing nature, and not the reverse. We all live in [the Matrix](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matrix_movie).


The predictions are falsifiable:

1. Come up with a task, such as writing poetry, that a brain can do, but not a digital computer.
1. Show that we cannot reproduce a physical process using a digital computer.


Yet, these predictions remain unfalsified to this day.

To put it bluntly: The most fundamental of all natural laws is that we live in a [Turing machine](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_machine).
