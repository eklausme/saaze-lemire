<p>But Darwin did come up with &ldquo;evolution from natural selection&rdquo;. The thing is, others did too and his idea was based on the work of one of his uncle and on Lamark and others.</p>
<p>It is not an &ldquo;accident&rdquo; that Wallace and Darwin both had the same idea. That is the point I am making.</p>
<p>There is no magical &ldquo;breakthrough&rdquo; due to one&rsquo;s superior brain. Our progress does not depend on a few heroes. That is a myth.</p>

<p>It is also a matter of how good you are at *creating* a social phenomenon. </p>
<p>In general, it is undeniable that there is a huge non-linearity on science and society progress. Our life is plenty of sudden booms and crushes, too use economical terms. Society and social (positive) feedback are the key behind this non-linearity, so that if a perturbation (such as a new invention) doesn&rsquo;t perturb the system over a given threshold, there won&rsquo;t be any noticeable long-term modification in it. </p>
<p>I agree, however, that becoming part of history and having superior ideas are two quite unrelated things!</p>

<p>I believe Kuhn&rsquo;s viewpoint is not that Darwin or anyone else discovered/invented/&#8230; a radically new science *singlehandedly*. His point is that we have both phases of science: normal science which is progressive, and revolutionary phase where previous ideas about how to do science and what is science change.<br/>
My understanding of his book is that it is not that much about how some people were great scientists, as opposed to how the science changes during time.</p>

<p>&#8230;and read Simon Winchester&rsquo;s excellent book on Joseph Needham&rsquo;s research into China&rsquo;s history of scientific discovery, The Man Who Loved China (<a href="https://tinyurl.com/9a7zjh" rel="nofollow ugc">http://tinyurl.com/9a7zjh</a>) for a further reminder that much of what we hear of science&rsquo;s history is Western-centric.</p>

<p>When I heard about Khun&rsquo;s notion of discontinuous scientific progress, my reaction was the same as yours: &ldquo;Hogwash!&rdquo; Darwin and Wallace is a great example of how ideas are built up, not suddenly invented.</p>
<p>Perhaps Khun is really getting at the appearance of ideas to the general public. Within a certain community, seemingly revolutionary ideas aren&rsquo;t novel at all (like reflection in programming systems these days or evolution in the mid-19th century) while the larger population outside of that community will have never heard of it. Perhaps, then, it is the appearance of a refined idea when released from the community that has been working to refine it that is the source of the Khun&rsquo;s discontinuity.</p>

<p>Progress is continuous, but &ldquo;revolutionary&rdquo; spurts happen, usually following a build-up phase. E.g. in the case of special relativity, there was a prior accumulation of observations contradicting the aether theory over a few decades.</p>
<p>The build-up phase is important for an important innovation to be recognized as such. Otherwise the discoverer is classified as a crackpot until the surrounding culture is ready for it. (Of course by that time s/he may be long forgotten.)</p>
<p>When the culture is ready for an innovation, multiple independent occurences are likely because there are many &ldquo;prepared minds&rdquo;.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a bit of old west wisdom that goes like this: &ldquo;If you&rsquo;re ridin&rsquo; ahead of the herd, take a look back every now and then, to make sure it&rsquo;s still there with ya.&rdquo; I like to think that it&rsquo;s good advice for scientists, too.</p>
<p>(Daniel, remind me to blog about this someday.)</p>
