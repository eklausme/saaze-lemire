title: "Canadian government is cutting science funding&#8230; in favor of business degrees!"
---



This [article](http://www.macleans.ca/politics/ottawa/lets-play-cut-the-granting-councils/) summarizes the results of the current funding cuts in research. It almost feels like Bush moved up North. Dozens of millions are being cut. My previous employer, the [National Research Council](http://www.nrc-cnrc.gc.ca/index.html)â€”Canada&rsquo;s largest research organizationâ€”was cut as well.
Fortunately, our wise government saw fit to compensate with more business degrees:

>  $17.5 million over three years to (&hellip;) to fund an additional 400 master&rsquo;s and 100 doctoral scholarships â€œfocused on business-related degrees.â€

__Summary:__ less funding for degrees in science, more funding for degrees in business.
