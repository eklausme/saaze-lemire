title: "What FriendFeed got wrong"
---



Don&rsquo;t you feel sometimes like your brain is running out of storage space? Myself, I am very forgetful. I always seek new tools to extend my brain.

[FriendFeed](http://www.friendfeed.com) is a fantastic social networking site. It lets you integrate all of your activities from all over the Web into a single flow. You can [browse mine](http://blog.friendfeed.com/). Unfortunately, it has failed to attract attention. Worse: many of its features have been copied by Facebook.

Instead of trying to compete with Facebook and Twitter, FriendFeed should offer [lifestreaming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lifestreaming): an indexed and exhaustive record of everything you have done, for all times. In effect, FriendFeed should be __an external-memory extension to your brain__.

__Note__: This blog post was inspired by a chat with my colleague and social-networking researcher Sébastien Paquet.
