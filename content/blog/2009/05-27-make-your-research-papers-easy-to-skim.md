title: "Make your research papers easy to skim"
---



Claus Metzner [asked us](http://friendfeed.com/cmetzner/3de8d0b6/when-did-you-last-time-study-scientific-paper-in) how often we read research papers carefully. He reads fully less than 1% of all research papers he comes across. This must be true of nearly everyone. We read a few titles, fewer abstracts, even fewer introductions, we skim a few papers, but we rarely read entire papers carefully.

We could blame [information overload](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_overload) and its academic companion: [publish or perish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish_or_perish). However,  when I read a research paper, most often, I only need to know the main contribution of the research paper. As Claus puts it:

> I don&rsquo;t care too much if the arguments, methods and results of a paper are 100% sound or not. Mostly I am hunting for small reusable items


Hence, we should:

- Pick good titles giving away the main insight (&ldquo;The Earth is round&rdquo; and not &ldquo;On the geometry of our planet&rdquo;);
- Pick good section headers giving away the conclusions of the section (replace &ldquo;Discussion&rdquo; by &ldquo;this drug fails to work&rdquo;);
- Use bullet points to outline our results;
- Use simple schemas and figures.


Ultimately, we should write research papers expecting our readers to barely skim them.
