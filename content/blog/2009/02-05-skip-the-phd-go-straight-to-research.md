title: "Skip the Ph.D., go straight to research"

[Satpalparmar](/lemire/blog/2009/01/30/how-to-ask-for-a-scholarship/#comments) got bad grades from an unknown university. He wants to become a researcher. And he asks me for advice.

I got good grades and a Ph.D. from one of the best universities in Canada, so who am I to give advice to people like Satpalparmar?

Nevertheless, here it is.

You do not need a Ph.D. to be a researcher. In fact, the requirement to have a Ph.D. is relatively recent. Go visit research labs in most governments and companies, and you will find smart people without a Ph.D. doing research. (I have famous people in mind, but I am afraid to point them out, for fear that they will take it the wrong way.) 

Here is a recipe that should turn you into a researcher, no matter who you are:

- Read research papers.
- Write and submit some research papers, books, booklets&hellip;
- Prepare and give talks in the field, anywhere where they will have you.
- Get involved in the field. Help organize events, conferences. __Connect__ with the researchers.


Build up your resume. Get some recognition.
