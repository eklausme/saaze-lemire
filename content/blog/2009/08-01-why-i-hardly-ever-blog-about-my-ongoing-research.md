title: "Why I hardly ever blog about my ongoing research"
---



When I started my blog in 2004, my goal was to blog about my research. It never happened.

You may think that I am afraid a reader could steal my ideas, or that I might worry about looking silly. But I have no such fear. However, I am afraid it could hurt the quality of my work. I need a sandbox for my research. The purpose of the sandbox is to protect my ideas from the pressure:

> What scientists really need is more time and more freedom to play with their ideas without pressure to fit in, to publish, to make up their mind. ([Backreaction](https://backreaction.blogspot.com/2009/07/and-how-open-would-you-want-your.html))


__Working without pressure on your own ideas is essential__ for science. By opening up too early on your research directions, you can face at least two problems:

- You commit to ideas before you had a chance of fighting self-delusion. Psychologists will tell you that once you write down and explain a position, you tend to stick with it. It is irrational, but true. I claim that this effect is less significant if you sketch ideas in your own private sandbox.
- Early on, your ideas are still fragile: an expert can destroy them by apparently reasonable criticism before you had a chance to root them into a solid framework.


In the early stage of my research, I am the best person to hold a critical view on my own work. Only later, when I have had the chance to explore the idea to my satisfaction, do I need the criticism of others.

This is not just a theory. Several years ago, I shared an idea with a prominent scientist. He generously repliedâ€”in detailsâ€”about why my idea was wrong. As part of his argument, he made a specific assertion which, if true, made my work uninteresting. A year later, I finally revisited the idea, and I determined that he was wrong, in a self-serving way.

Silence and long hours alone in front of a desk are necessary for strong original ideas.
