title: "Why are dynamic languages easier than static languages?"
---



Dynamic langages like Python or Ruby are considerably easier than static languages like Java and C++. John is asking us [why](http://stackoverflow.com/questions/379128/how-do-you-program-differently-in-dynamic-languages/732769):

> How do you account for the huge increases in productivity that dynamic language advocates say they experience.


My answer is [duck typing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing). It is powerful because formal and tight definitions are hard and [less useful than we might expect](/lemire/blog/2007/12/05/formal-definitions-are-less-useful-than-you-think/).

The difference is fundamental:

Static view              |Dynamic view             |
-------------------------|-------------------------|
Tight definitions        |Duck typing              |
Ontologies               |Folksonomies             |
Specific solutions       |Generic solutions        |
