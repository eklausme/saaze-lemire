title: "Solving new and difficult theory problems&#8230; without looping into oblivion"
---



Sometimes you decide that you need a specific theoretical result. For example, you may need a closed form formula for a given quantity. Yet, you barely know how to begin.

Maybe, you end up <em>looping</em>: you keep on revisiting the same ideas, again and again. You don&rsquo;t seem to make any progress at all!
What do you do? Don&rsquo;t be hasty to conclude that you can&rsquo;t do theory. Mathematicians are just ordinary people.

Some advice that has worked for me:

- Be patient. Work incrementally.- At first, don&rsquo;t try to prove conjectures. Begin by trying to disprove them! It is often much easier to disprove something than to prove it. And most conjectures end up being false.
- Find the simplest non-trivial variation on your problem, and work from there instead. What you will learn from solving a closely related problem might teach you how to break the real problem. A related strategy is to work on specific examples.
- Be paranoid. Check every single fact or claim twice. And then check it again.
- Run computer simulations to check your mathematics, or to suggest new conjectures.
- Draw pictures. Use your visual cortex.
- Try to abstract out the problem: find a more general problem. Sometimes, specific problems appear more difficult than general ones because you are thrown off by irrelevant details.
- Be thorough. __When trying to solve a difficult theoretical problem, be neat.__ For example, work as if you are trying to explain your problem to someone else.
