I love gardening. I love research.

These activities are analogous:

Gardening                |Research                 |
-------------------------|-------------------------|
Biodiversity minimizes the impact of diseases and pests. |A multidisciplinary or broad research program is more resilient against [systemic failures](https://www.amazon.com/Trouble-Physics-String-Theory-Science/dp/061891868X/ref=pd_bbs_sr_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1219324200&amp;sr=8-1). |
Plants grow according to their own rythms. You can rush a plant with fertilizers, but the plant will become fragile and short-lived. (Example: using fertilizers with a [coreopsis](http://www.flickr.com/photos/tags/coreopsis/) is a bad idea.) If you want quick results, pick the plant accordingly. |Some research programs take years to unfold and bear fruits. In such cases, telling people to publish more will only generate weak and forgettable papers. |
Gardening requires regularity. You cannot easily do all of your gardening one day a week. |Working almost daily is the best way to push your research program forward. Systematically rushing prior to the deadlines will only work if you have frequent deadlines. |
