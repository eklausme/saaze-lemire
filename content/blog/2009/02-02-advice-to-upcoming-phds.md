A fair question. I currently supervise two Ph.D. students in Computer Science. Hence, I have thought about the problem.

My advice:

1. Be prepared for the worst. No matter how good you are. I work for a non-prestigious school, and the last guy we hiredâ€”this winterâ€”had three research grants, fifteen graduate students, 40 research articles&hellip; Few recent Ph.D. graduates can compete.
1. Look for research jobs at unusual places. Widely advertised positions at prestigious places are only a small fraction of all jobs.
1. Do not wait until you nearly have your Ph.D. in hand to look for jobs. Plan one or two years ahead.
1. Random emails to professors are not useful. But a well-placed email can get you a job. Do not spam, but  email.
1. You may have some control about when you finish your Ph.D. Try to finish just in time to get a job, not sooner, not later.
1. An industry job is always an option. Or start your own business. Be warned that getting back to academia may not be easy.
1. There are good non-tenure-track positions. Do not fool yourself into thinking they lead to tenure.
