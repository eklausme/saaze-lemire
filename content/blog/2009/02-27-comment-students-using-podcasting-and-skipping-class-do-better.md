<p>I&rsquo;m not too surprised. The value of a live instructor is interaction. If you have a lively Socratic discussion in class, students would probably learn a lot in class but not get much out of it from a recording. But if you&rsquo;re just going to be a talking head, might as well make a quality recording and let students press pause.</p>
<p>(I overstate my case. Even an uninterrupted lecture can still have a subtle form of interaction, reacting to non-verbal feedback from students.)</p>

<p>I personally don&rsquo;t see the point of attending lectures without the possibility of interaction&#8211;ideally with both the lecturer and fellow attendees. For that matter, I usually prefer reading text to listening to it. I skipped a significant fraction of lectures in college.</p>
<p>That said, I know many people who prefer to learn by listening to lectures&#8211;and prefer to do so live. And I do enjoy live presentations from passionate speakers&#8211;passion is something that is often diluted by other forms of communication. I never missed a lecture from the late Gian-Carlo Rota if I could help it.</p>
<p>Good lectures are as much about theater as about content.</p>

<p>It would be interesting to see how a third group did &#8212; those that went to the lecture and had access to the recording to review/reinforce what they heard.</p>
<p>Thinking back to my own ugrad career, one function that attending lectures really helped with was keeping a good pace throughout the term, not letting stuff pile up .</p>
