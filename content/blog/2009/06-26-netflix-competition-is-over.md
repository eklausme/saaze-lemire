title: "Netflix competition is over?"
---



The [Netflix competition](http://www.netflixprize.com/) is a $1 million research competition to improve the Netflix movie recommender system by 10%. A large team called [BellKor&rsquo;s Pragmatic Chaos](http://www.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/bpc.html) just announced that they won (update: unless someone can beat them in the next month). Among them is Yehuda Koren with whom I organized the [2nd Netflix-KDD Workshop](http://netflixkddworkshop2008.info/) and also some engineers from my home town (Piotte and Chabbert). I do not know how they will split the money, but I suspect each one of them will get at least 100k$. 

I want a study on the benefits of this new technology on the Netflix users.
