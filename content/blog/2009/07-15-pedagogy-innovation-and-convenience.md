title: "Pedagogy, innovation and convenience"

Organizing learning around courses implies the creation of groups and a tight control by professors. It is <em>convenient</em> to organize students into classes, and grade students by topics. Industry-based economies are similarly convenient. They are hierarchical with a clear reporting structure. However, it is slow-moving and boring.

Tim Bray is proposing to [rearrange Computer Science degrees](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2009/07/14/Web-Curriculum) in a Web-centric manner.  Here are some arguments he could have used:

- Many prospective students are interested in Computer Science precisely because they think that <em>the Web is cool</em>! I am certain a Web-centric curriculum would attract more students.
- Web technology is an endless source of Computer Science applications<em>.</em> For example, Web sites presenting sorted lists will be faster when using [Quicksort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quicksort) than when using [Bubble sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bubble_sort), Google uses [Graph theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pagerank) to quantify the relative importance of Web sites and Amazon uses Machine Learning to recommend products.


Alas, most schools are simply unable to be so agile. Simply picking a Computer language can be a political issue. Changing the pedagogy of several core courses within a few years might be impossible. Thus, nearly 20 years after the invention of the Web, many Computer Science programs barely address the Web.

My solution? My dream? I wish I could work within open problem-based Computer Science programs. And the fact that professors spend so much time with graduate students tells me I am not alone. And do not tell me it is not possible at the undergraduate level: people have been doing it for years in biology and medicine. But it is <em>inconvenient</em>.
