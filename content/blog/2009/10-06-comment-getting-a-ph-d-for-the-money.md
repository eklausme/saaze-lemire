<p>If someone thinks a PhD is a great financial investment, that makes me question their business sense.</p>

<p>My PhD hasn&rsquo;t really helped me make money but it does bring me some credibility. I expect, though, that if you can defend a thesis for a PhD it is those skills that could lead to you making money. The PhD won&rsquo;t do much on it&rsquo;s own.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;m certainly not in it for the money. If I were, I&rsquo;d have gone and found another software job instead of going to grad school.</p>
<p>Back to the point, I think that people who create successful startups have a good and (more importantly) marketable idea. It doesn&rsquo;t take a PhD for that. </p>
<p>Consider Dropbox, for example. It&rsquo;s just version control for non-developers. But it was certainly marketed the right way.</p>

<p>The real cost of the PhD is the opportunity cost of 6 years. The difference in salary for a software engineer is roughly $250k in income. Or the startup opportunities not pursued. </p>
<p>When I was at IBM master&rsquo;s degrees were a dime a dozen. The best technical people I knew had PhDs. They influenced my decision to pursue one.</p>

<p>My PhD made it harder to find a job when I left academia. People were &ldquo;impressed&rdquo; but they weren&rsquo;t offering me a job. The assumption seemed to be that having a PhD meant that you were probably a terrible programmer. (I&rsquo;ve seen anecdotal evidence to support this prejudice, though I&rsquo;ve also known some PhDs who were top notch programmers.)</p>
<p>I got my PhD because I wanted to learn a lot of math and because I wanted to teach college. I&rsquo;m very glad I went to grad school, but I didn&rsquo;t do it to maximize my income. </p>
<p>A PhD may pay for itself financially, though it would take a few years since as Jeff pointed out there is a large up-front opportunity cost.</p>

<p>I suspect that few people optimize their lifetime income by investing several years in a computer science PhD. But I can say from personal experience that the PhD opens doors. I suspect it would have been a lot harder for me to get where I am without it.</p>

<p>I think in many situations (i.e. getting a job as a programmer), having a Ph.D. will indeed be overkill, and sometimes even a disadvantage. From a manager&rsquo;s perspective, I would rather hire a bachelor who was passionate about programming than a Ph.D. who wasn&rsquo;t, even if the Ph.D. candidate was &ldquo;smarter&rdquo;. </p>
<p>As for entrepreneurs, I think good ideas, creativity and persistence are far more important than formal education when it comes to success in business.</p>
<p>If people are getting a Ph.D. because they love research, I think that&rsquo;s awesome. If they are doing it do get a well-paid job, I think that&rsquo;s just a waste of time and they would be better off spending their time doing something they enjoy instead.</p>

<p>Let me add to what John said that even though you have done a lot of programming in your PhD study, it is still mostly considered to be &lsquo;useless programming&rsquo; skills for the Industry, because from the &lsquo;company&rsquo; perspective, programming for research has nothing to do with the &lsquo;programming&rsquo; that they want you to have. For example, being a heavy Matlab or R programmer has nothing to do with being a valuable skillful web developer, to a level that you cannot even stand in front of those Java EE or Rails geeks who haven&rsquo;t even got any academic certificates!</p>

<p>I was never in it for the money. That said, I must acknowledge that my company paid for my Ph.D. I&rsquo;m certain I would have done it on my own though, whether digging myself into a financial hole or not.</p>

<p>It is worth noting that there are some quite interesting positions you simply cannot get without a PhD (e.g. in academia or research labs). Even if it does not mean a higher salary, the PhD opens doors that might be otherwise closed.</p>

<p>I do not think that PhD has much financial sense. Instead of spending 3-4 years doing research , one might start his career in a big company and advance pretty fast. IF you do the same amount of work as required for a good PhD (= say research enough to produce 3-5 publications at the top conferences or journals, teaching assistance, PC membership and reviewing etc ), then it is more than enough to get a pretty high seniorship in any company. So PhD is not the best way to get money or start career.<br/>
But in this 3-4 years, one can learn really a lot and do HIS OWN research , investigate topics he is interest din instead of doing some assigned projects<br/>
One go to conferences and LEARNS a lot<br/>
This is the most important</p>

<p>Hi daniel, I have been reading your article for a long time. You are writing very interesting article and it drags my attension read it and i also have given my comment on some of your articles.</p>
<p>This topic impressed me because people often relate education with money. i think it is because of commercialization in education. now a days, colleges are charging more. so, students also started thinking about money when they start their studies.</p>
<p>I strongly believe in knowledge. the divine is what did i achieve in my research? it is not that how much will i earn?<br/>
correct me if i am wrong.</p>

<p>I could not agree more. In many places, e.g. France, a PhD actually makes you less employable, or won&rsquo;t increase your salary.</p>
