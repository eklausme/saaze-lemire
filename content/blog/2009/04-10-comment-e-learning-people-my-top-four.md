<p>John Seely Brown invented this concept of learning object which I found intresting some time ago:&rdquo;As the notion of learning objects developed and ideas about how learning objects could be assembled to provide learning experiences evolved, models or metaphors to explain the processes were developed. One of the earliest metaphors likened the assembling or aggregation of learning objects to building a Lego project. The Lego pieces, like learning objects, could be assembled easily and by almost anybody, into more complicated and meaningful structures&rdquo;. in his website <a href="http://www.johnseelybrown.com" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.johnseelybrown.com</a>, you can find references to other website that implemented learning objects, among other things.</p>
