title: "Attributes of good research"
---



Paul Graham gives[ a list of attributes characterizing start-ups](http://paulgraham.com/kate.html). It strikes me that many of these attributes could describe research projects as well:

1. __Good research projects fail.__ If there is no risk of failure, you are doing unoriginal research. (Except that out of my biggest failures have come out some of my best papers&hellip;)
1. __Good research directions change frequently.__ Otherwise, how can you be following the truth where it must lead you? (Except that if you keep changing direction, you&rsquo;ll never get anything done.)
1. __It takes little money.__ While some research projects are expensive, Einstein changed Physics forever without a research grant. (Except that if you are worrying about your next pay check, you can hardly worry about research.)
1. __Good research is threatening.__ If your research never upsets anyone, maybe you are not pushing hard enough? (Except that you should not be bold just for boldness sake.)
1. __Research is a solitary task.__ Ultimately, all research projects involve many hours working alone. (Except that research is fundamentally social!)
