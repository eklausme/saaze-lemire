title: "Where do the best mathematicians come from?"
---



Americans think that the best scientists come from their best universities. To learn more, consider where the influential mathematicians from:

got their degree in the USA |33%                      |
-------------------------|-------------------------|
got their Ph.D. in the USA |58%                      |
working in the USA       |68%                      |


The American scientific dominance relies partially on the ability of the USA to attract and retain the best and the brightest:

- 33.6% of European PhDs were attracted to faculty or research positions in the US.
- 55% of non-European foreign PhDs were attracted to faculty positions in the US.
- Only 10% of American Ph.D.s go work abroad.
