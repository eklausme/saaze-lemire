<p>Introducing intermediate steps, such as metadata extraction, should be done with care. Specifically, you should validate that it is useful!</p>
<p>You&rsquo;d think it would be a trivial point&#8230; yet&#8230;</p>

<p>I agree that ontologies (as in &ldquo;library classification systems&rdquo;) can&rsquo;t save us, but if you approve of Everything is Miscellaneous, you should also approve of Folksonomies.</p>
<p>If people can decide their own categories or define their own labels, you at least are freed from someone else&rsquo;s rigid and perhaps outdated knowledge classification scheme. </p>
<p>In some circumstances, it might even work better than ML methods for term extraction from full-text. Consider the case where terminology changes over time (e.g. &ldquo;AI&rdquo; -&gt; &ldquo;Agents&rdquo;). Folksonomic tagging might allow you to identify an &rsquo;80s paper on (what used to be known as) &ldquo;knowledge representation&rdquo; as relevant to a &ldquo;Mobile Agent&rdquo; application, whereas term-extraction alone might not give you that information.</p>

<p>So, it seems we are in agreement, aren&rsquo;t we?</p>

<p>I had very specific papers in mind while writing this post. I assure you, there are people who extract metadata, throw away the document and then work exclusively from the metadata.</p>

<p>Back in 1997, when I took my first grad-level Information Retrieval course, I remember Bruce Croft saying that there had been experiments done through the 80s and 90s, about the relative value of full-text indexing vs. abstract-only vs. metadata/keyword only.</p>
<p>Full-text won every time. </p>
<p>Can&rsquo;t remember any specific citations, though. I suppose I could ask Bruce.</p>

<p>I also remember a paper at WSDM 2008 from some Yahoo folks, that looked at folksonomic document (web page) tagging. At the risk of misparaphrasing from memory: I think they found that once you got rid of all the tags for terms that were already found in the document itself (i.e. something that a full-text search could already match on) and then got rid of all the tags that were non-descriptive opinions, such as &ldquo;cool&rdquo; and &ldquo;I like this&rdquo;, there wasn&rsquo;t much information left. </p>
<p>So even with folksonomies, I don&rsquo;t fully understand how much utility they really provide over full-text indexing.</p>

<p>If all you&rsquo;re interested is implementing ranked retrieval, and you have no access to human input; then, as you note, metadata extraction only serves as a form of feature reduction. </p>

<p>Good points, Daniel. I think I agree, if you&rsquo;re talking about interfaces alone. And I don&rsquo;t completely disagree, if what you are saying is that you can use summaries and metadata as augmentation (e.g. enhanced term frequency) on the underlying full text. </p>
<p>But too often, I see people throwing away the full-content, in favor of metadata only. Especially in the multimedia retrieval work that I&rsquo;ve done, such as music. Lots of companies and research do recommendation and retrieval based on user tags, only, and don&rsquo;t take the time or effort to go in and signal-process/analyze the music itself, to use that full-content as a critical piece of the similarity match.</p>

<p>I wasn&rsquo;t sure how broadly you meant &ldquo;aggregating content&rdquo;, but if that entails any processing that might improve the ability of people to interact with the content, then we&rsquo;re in agreement on that point.</p>
<p>As for the papers that completely throw out the content, that seems silly unless it&rsquo;s for efficiency reasons. Feature reduction can certainly help eliminate noise, but I can&rsquo;t think of a reason other than efficiency to employ an irrevocably lossy compression technique.</p>

<p>I think that full text statistics indexing as proved itself better than tagging.</p>
<p>A second element that a good litterature search engine should have is to use cross references to better relates papers and to more easely find the more central ones.</p>
<p>Sincerly, I think our current litt search schemes/indexes are obsolete compared to what we could have.</p>

<p>I completely agree that meta-data needs to be let go in many cases, it is possible that humans keep usen it because we feel more comfortable with a strict definition and delimitation of the domain in which they are working at. If we let go meta-data we are no longer in an area with clear boundaries and definition, things become fuzzy, like in real life.</p>

<p>I fully agree with the fact that content is more important than meta-data.</p>
<p>I would also add a few comments: meta-data should be a combination of human and computer generated information. The computer generated part should be from real content and (if possible) from the context (i.e. the full website that hosts a page, and so on).</p>
<p>Moreover, one should keep in mind that, meta-data changes over time, changes from one user to another (â€¦). Thus in the end and according to me, using meta-data requires heavier processes than using real content. However, this issue is evaluated neither in research nor in industry.</p>
<p>Why? The answer is simple: meta-data is available with documents, why bother generating something else? Let&rsquo;s just suppose that the available meta-data is: 1) correct; 2) not changing over time; 3) has no variability among usersâ€¦ and just use it!</p>
