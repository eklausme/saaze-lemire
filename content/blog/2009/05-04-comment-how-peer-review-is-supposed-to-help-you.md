<p>Of course, you are entirely right Daniel &#8211; at least from the point of view of ethics. But your advice goes against every edict in the academic rat race.</p>
<p>(a) publish as much as you can (publishing frequency = research quality)<br/>
(b) get grants to fund your research (requires [a])<br/>
(c) use grant money to fund students&rsquo; work that you can use to satisfy (a) and (b).</p>

<p>Andre: While there are certainly incentives to maximize your publication rate, there are other incentives in play as well.</p>
<p>If you write fewer, better papers, you are likely to me more respected by your peers &#8212; do you think more highly of someone who writes high-quality, insightful papers at a moderate pace, or someone who churns out mediocrity? Someone who focuses on quality is also likely to be cited more (one hopes), and to win &ldquo;10 year&rdquo; awards and the like. A researcher&rsquo;s reputation is built on doing great work, not doing lots and lots of boring work.</p>

<p>I intend to fully follow your advice once I have a secure enough position.</p>

<p>And they call me an idealist! While I&rsquo;m not an academic, my impression of life inside the ivory tower is similar that that of Julian and Andre: the pressure to be a publishing machine often outweighs other considerations, at least in the early years. It is indeed a depressing goal&#8211;and was a key factor in my decision not to pursue an academic career after completing my PhD.</p>

<p>OK, today&rsquo;s story:</p>
<p>A senior, well-respected professor comes to my office and asks how I am doing. </p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Kind of busy lately trying to prepare my promotion package&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Senior Prof: &ldquo;How many journal papers do you have&rdquo;?</p>
<p>Me: &ldquo;Six, and two of them under advanced stages of review&rdquo;</p>
<p>Senior Prof: &ldquo;And you are already up for promotion?&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is a person who is going to vote in my case a few months from now.</p>

<p>@panos I&rsquo;ve got roughly the same number of journal articles and I got my promotion to full prof. There were 3 external people, at least&#8230; and nobody said anything about the *number* of papers I wrote.</p>
<p>So, maybe there is hope, after all!</p>
