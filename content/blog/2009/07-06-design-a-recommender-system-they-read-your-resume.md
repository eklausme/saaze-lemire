title: "Design a recommender system: they read your resume"
---



[Goodreads](http://www.goodreads.com/lemire/) is a Social Web site about books. They need a recommender system. Thus, they issued a challenge: design their recommendation engine, and they will read your resume.Â I suppose this is the poor man&rsquo;s version of the [Netflix challenge](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2009/06/26/netflix-competition-is-over/).

There is nothing wrong with the challenge, but I wish the current Goodreads engineers would publish their own recommender system. How hard can it be to do [item-based analysis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Slope_One)?

__Update__: Students at Stanford built and tested a [recommender system for Goodreads](http://www.stanford.edu/class/cs229/proj2008/IsaacsonSebastian-GoodReadsRecommendations.pdf).
