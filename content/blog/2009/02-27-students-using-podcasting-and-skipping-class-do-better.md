title: "Students using podcasting and skipping class&#8230; do better!"
---



According to a recent study, students do better if they skip class and listen to the podcasts. The article has been discussed in the <a href="https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16624-itunes-university-better-than-the-real-thing?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news" target="_blank">New Scientist</a> and the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/external/readwriteweb/2009/02/25/25readwriteweb-itunes_u_proves_better_than_class.html" target="_blank">New York Times</a>, but here is a direct quote:

> Results indicated that students in the podcast condition who took notes while listening to the podcast scored significantly higher than the lecture condition.


The article is not hard science. It is a single set of experiments. What I like though, is the observation made by the [New Scientist](https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn16624-itunes-university-better-than-the-real-thing?DCMP=OTC-rss&amp;nsref=online-news) that <em>podcast lectures are good for lecturers too</em>. On this subject, see my post Be a good teacher where I point out that the focus on delivering the _content_ is wrong.
