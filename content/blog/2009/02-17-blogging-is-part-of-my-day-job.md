title: "Blogging is part of my day job"
---



I decided to copy [Daniel Tunkelang&rsquo;s idea](http://thenoisychannel.com/2009/01/15/the-noisy-community) and maintain [a list of some people who read my blog](/lemire/blog/my-readers/). This is not meant to be an ego-boosting or name-dropping project. My goal is to prove that __blogging is a serious business__. __Blogging is part of my day job__! Indeed, this list proves that professional networking results from my blog.
