title: "How to ask for a scholarship"
---



I have had some experience reviewing scholarship requests from graduate students. Here are a few pointers:

- For God&rsquo;s sake! Know why you are going to graduate school! Boring reasons include: learning more about your favorite field, wanting to become a professor one day, finding your topic fascinating (why is it fascinating?), and so on. Yes! __You are expected to figure out an original and interesting story as to why you are trying to get a Ph.D.! __Yes, it is hard! That&rsquo;s the point!
- Avoid telling us about how good your school, supervisor or department is. Assume we know.
- Waste no time telling us why you got bad grades or why you have no research experience. We know you are young. We know bad grades can happen.
- Have some accepted research papers. Short of that, claim to have submitted research papers. Short of that, post some research reports on your web site. No need to dump a large list, but have <em>something</em>. Everyone can submit a research paper to a journal or a conference! Show that you are trying!
- Avoid telling us about your teaching experience. Not relevant. We are not hiring you as an instructor!
- Come up with a simple, original and clear research proposal. It is no time to explain complicated ideas!
- Avoid specialized acronyms or terminology. I do not know the first thing about robots, but I still have to read your proposal. Make it interesting to me!


To sum it up:

- Write well.
- Be interesting.
- Be original.


Extra pointers:

- Do not join 20 sheet of papers when one would suffice.
- When given 2 pages, take 2 pages! It is no time to pull a 10-liner!
- If asked to provide 2 letters of references, do so! Do exactly as your told. Provide a complete file!
