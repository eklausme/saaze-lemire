title: "Netflix game gets exciting: BellKor´s Pragmatic Chaos is passed by The Ensemble"
---



This is fun. A month ago, I asked whether the [Netflix competition was over](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2009/06/26/netflix-competition-is-over/). After [BellKor&rsquo;s Pragmatic Chaos](http://www.research.att.com/~volinsky/netflix/bpc.html) merged the solutions of many players to break the 10% barrier, I expected them to win. It turns out that another coalition was createdâ€”[The Ensemble](http://www.the-ensemble.com/)â€”and they have [beaten the previous best score](http://www.netflixprize.com//leaderboard?limit=50) by 0.01%. There are only a short few hours before the final deadline, so it is still impossible to know who will win. However, if The Ensemble wins, it will be very frustrating to BellKor&rsquo;s Pragmatic Chaos: The Ensemble is a last minute player.

Both teams broke the 10% barrier by using a diverse coalition, by merging several different ideas. As Peter Turney recently stated:

> There are no whole-truths, but we can get by reasonably well with a large number of half-truths.


I am now more convinced than ever that science needs diverse explanations, techniques and opinions. We should actively reward creativity. [Science is not merely about truth-seeking](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2009/03/20/research-productivity-some-paths-less-travelled/).
