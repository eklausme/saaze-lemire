<p>I doubt many people outside of academia understand how much research is driven by external motivation. From the outside, it looks like faculty, especially tenured faculty, are free to pursue whatever they are interested in. In practice, most faculty are driven by publications and grants.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a great talk and something I generally agree with, but I am not sure when he asserts that management is a human creation. Management might be an inevitable consequence overhead of a coordinated effort.</p>

<p><a href="https://rjlipton.wordpress.com/2009/08/13/amplifying-on-the-pcr-amplifier/" rel="nofollow">Mullis invented PCR while he was employed at Cetus, now a defunct company. He got a $10,000 invention award, while Cetus eventually sold the patent rights for 300 million dollars. This was back when this was real money, even today that is a pretty good amount for a single patent. Mullis was not happy with the size of his award, which is not hard to understand.</a></p>
