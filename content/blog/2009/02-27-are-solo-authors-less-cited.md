title: "Are solo authors less cited?"
---



Sylvie NoÃ«l submits to us the following fallacyâ€”which appears in the [editorial](http://www.webology.ir/2008/v5n4/editorial18.html) of a peer-reviewed journal. The editor-in-chief makes the following observation:

> (&hellip;) only a small fraction of the top 100 papers ranked by the number of citations (17 of 100) were published by single authors.


From this, he makes the following conclusion:

> (&hellip;) a published paper resulting from collaborative work has a higher chance of attracting more citations.


I leave it as an exercise to figure out why the logic is wrong.

But the implication is that __solo authors are less interesting__. Instead, I believe that solo authors probably work on different problems. (Hint: This could be the subject of a study of its own!)
Why?

Because of something I call <em>problem inertia</em>. For collaboration to occur, several people must come together and agree to a joint project. Sometimes money is required to pay the assistants or the students. All of these factor means that <em>small problems</em> or <em>risky problems</em> will be ignored in favor of __safe bets__. To put it bluntly, Microsoft will not sell PHP plugins! Hence, statistically, teams must be deliberate and careful. Also, fewer problems can be visited: even if the selected problem is a bad one, changing the topic in mid-course might be too expensive.

An autonomous author can afford to take more risks. Even more so if he has a permanent position. This may explain why [Peter Turney](http://www.apperceptual.com/) seems to believe that researchers lack ambition. They may simply be rational: if it takes you three weeks to even get started on a project, you cannot afford many false starts!

Consider [Seth Roberts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seth_Roberts)&lsquo; [self-experimentation](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Self-experimentation) strategy and Roberts&rsquo; [take](http://blog.sethroberts.net/2008/12/21/are-you-having-trouble-getting-grants/) regarding funding:

> One reason my self-experimentation was effective was it didn&rsquo;t depend on grants. No matter what I found, no matter how strange or upsetting or impossible or weird the results might be, I could publish them and continue to investigate them.


This view supports my theory that solo authors will work on different problems.

__Note__: I do hold a couple of research grants currently. I write almost all my research papers with others.
