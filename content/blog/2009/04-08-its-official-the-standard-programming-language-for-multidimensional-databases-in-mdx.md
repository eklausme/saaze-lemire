title: "Its official: the standard programming language for multidimensional databases is MDX"

Julian Hyde [just announced](https://julianhyde.blogspot.com/2009/04/last-mdx-holdout-folds-but-true-olap.html) that Oracle will support [MDX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_Expressions): they were the last vendor to resist this Microsoft technology. MDX is to [multidimensional databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multidimensional_database) what SQL is to relational database. 

I am disappointed that MDX is the best we could come up with. I don&rsquo;t find MDX enjoyable.
