title: "A researcherÂ´s garden"
---



I love gardening. I get [good results](http://www.flickr.com/photos/lemire/) too. However, my wife is very critical of my techniques.
- While I work hard, my work is often obtuse. Who grows his perennials from seeds  these days? The result matters less to me than what I learn in the process.
- I do not care for uniformity, I prefer diversity. For example, I currently have 7 types of Morning Glory. I am always experimenting.
