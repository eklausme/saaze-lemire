<p>Some areas move much faster than others. </p>
<p>I started out in PDEs and now I&rsquo;m in biostatistics. I was surprised by the differences in publishing in the two areas. PDE papers are much harder to publish: it&rsquo;s harder to be original since the field is more mature, and papers typically have fewer authors. </p>
<p>I enjoy being in a faster-moving area, and it sounds like you do as well.</p>

<p>The most prolific and inventive researchers I&rsquo;ve known tend to switch away from a (sub)field as soon as it starts to solidify.</p>
<p>However, because they provide outlets for career advancement, some fields continue to exist and push papers out long after their leading lights have deserted it and gone into more exciting/promising directions.</p>
