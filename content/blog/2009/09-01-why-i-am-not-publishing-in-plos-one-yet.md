title: "Why I am not publishing in PLoS One, yet"

[PLoS One](http://www.plosone.org/home.action) is a new peer-reviewed journal (2006) with many interesting features:

- The board includes many respected Computer Scientists: [Ananth Grama](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/g/Grama:Ananth.html), [Johan Bollen](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/b/Bollen:Johan.html), [Josh C. Bongard](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/b/Bongard:Josh_C=.html), [Robert P. Futrelle](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/pers/hd/f/Futrelle:Robert_P=.html), etc.
- It is the largest Open Access journal in the world: 2,800 articles published in 2008.
- They accept [LaTeX submissions](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/s/latex).
- Readers can annotate, rate and comment on published papers.
- They have RSS feeds everywhere.
- The publication fees are fair.
- They have the [coolest ad ever](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mBmsLHa83vo).


Unfortunately, for a Computer Scientist, it is not yet attractive:

- The [Computer Science section](http://www.plosone.org/article/browse.action?catName=Computer+Science&amp;field=) is filled with biology and medicine papers making use of Information Technology. In other words, the PLoS One taxonomy  confuses Information Technology and Computer Science! Thankfully, I could find [one article in Natural Language Processing](http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0005372) which might be the first and only Computer Science paper published in PLoS One. So there is hope.
- As a related point, PLoS One is not indexed at the usual places as a Computer Science journal ([DBLP](http://www.informatik.uni-trier.de/~ley/db/), [ACM DL](http://dl.acm.org/dl.cfm), and so on). Of course, no Computer Science indexing is possible until PLoS One correctly classifies the Computer Science articles.


If they could fix these problems, I would gladly submit some of my work to them. PLoS One could become a useful journal in Computer Science over time. What about prestige? PLoS One uses [article-level metrics](http://blogs.plos.org/everyone/2009/05/27/article-level-metrics-at-plos/). Instead of trying to be a prestigious journal, PLoS One helps you measure the impact of your own papers.


__Update__: PLoS Computational Biology is now indexed by DBLP.
