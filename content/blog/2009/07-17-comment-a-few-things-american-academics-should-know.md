<p>Even comparing apples to apples (population wise), i.e. California vs. Canada, there is a factor of 2x more universities in California (at least according to Wikipedia). If that scales to the rest of the US, it means that there are ~ 20x more universities in the US.</p>

<p>Interesting. This brings another question: do you reward the best people, or do you equally distribute the reward to everyone?</p>
<p>I think the US model is designed to increase competition. If all 30 or so research universities were equal, would anyone go the extra effort to get into one? I mean, you&rsquo;d have lowered the bar to make all these schools equal &#8230; this applies not to college/grad school applicants, but also to faculty job seekers. I am not saying that model is better than the Canadian model &#8230; but competition often forces people to strive harder. </p>
<p>The 9-month professorship in US is, of course, a bit awkward. But then again, this allows professors to diversify their research during the summer months. There isn&rsquo;t that much teaching to do in summer anyway &#8230; at least in U of Illinois, almost everyone, including the grad students, are gone during summer to their internships.</p>

<p>@Mikhail Lemeshko,</p>
<p>Well, at least in CS, among the top 10 CS grad schools, half are public (Berkeley, UIUC, Washington, GeorgiaTech, UT-Austin).</p>

<p>Also, a typical misconception is that Canada is a big country. Canada has fewer people than California. There is simply not room for a power law!</p>

<p>&#8230;not mentioning Europe. ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>For instance, in Germany, all universities are supposed to be equal. Of course, they are not, but there is no huge difference between those.</p>
<p>Also, most of research is done in institutes belonging to the Max Planck Society. Being a professor in one of these, you can never apply for grants and feel yourself happy &#8211; even doing experiments. At least, there is no problem to pay another student or postdoc: you just hire a suitable person, and the Society pays the salary.</p>
<p>Of course, people building machines for a few millions of euro apply for external funding, which they usually get.</p>

<p>Addressing a comment by Ragib Hasan &#8211; I think the reason might be that most of top US schools are private. So, better research means more students and more money, which is not the case in other countries.</p>
