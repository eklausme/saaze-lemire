title: "The missing research tool&#8230;"
---



I want to know when a new research paper&hellip;

- is similar to one of my papers;
- cites one of my papers;
- is relevant to my current research.


Why can&rsquo;t I have this already? Why do I have to manually go to Google Scholar to monitor what my peers are doing? But Google Scholar always fall short because it does not know <em>Daniel Lemire</em> is as a researcher. 

Years of research in [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing) should make the construction of such a tool almost as easy as building a bridge. It is not difficult to parse my research papers, learn from it, and detect similar papers as they appear on the net.

So we need a new generation of tools:

- The tool knows who the researcher is, what he published, what he cited&hellip;
- The tool knows what the researcher is currently working upon.
- The tool can filter and aggregate the data automatically and offer it to the researcher without effort.
- The tool promotes open access content when possible.


I would pay for such a tool.
