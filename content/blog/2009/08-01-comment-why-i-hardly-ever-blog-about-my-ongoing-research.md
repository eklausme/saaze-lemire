<p>Keeping ideas private seems like a kludge forced by a a social problem.</p>
<p>In effect, you&rsquo;re describing the brainstorming stage of idea creation. Experienced facilitators know that a successful brainstorm does not censor; Breakthroughs are often had when someone suggests an apparently silly avenue.</p>
<p>That self-serving professor is toxic for a research lab. It&rsquo;s sad, most fields are full of people that don&rsquo;t know to avoid in-depth criticism for new projects and ideas.</p>

<p>This post sounds more like rationalization than explanation. Sure, you may prefer to work alone and in silence. But your appeal to some psychological principles is a stretch.</p>
<p>Presumably, the same psychological principles would apply to me. But I always work in a noisy environment &#8211; I have the radio on, the TV on, maybe a YouTube video playing. And while working alone works for me in some cases &#8211; coding, for example, my genuinely _creative_ moments only occur when I&rsquo;m in front of an audience of some sort trying to explain why I think the way I think.</p>
<p>What happens to me is the exact opposite of the principles you describe: I am more inclined to stick to a position _until_ I have to write it down, present it, or explain it. And my ideas are their strongest early on, and the criticism of experts is more likely to be placed on &lsquo;hold&rsquo; until I&rsquo;ve had the chance to work through the idea in detail.</p>

<p>Hi Daniel,</p>
<p>I agree with you, it was the same with me. Commenters asked repeatedly why I don&rsquo;t write about my own research, or if I do, it&rsquo;s a summary of a paper I just put out. The reason is as you say. If I&rsquo;m still thinking about something, I don&rsquo;t want to commit to it before I&rsquo;ve made up my mind. And if I&rsquo;ve made up my mind, I&rsquo;ll publish it. </p>
<p>That is not to say I don&rsquo;t talk to anybody. I talk to colleagues or friends of whom I know they are supportive rather than disruptive to my thought processes. It just isn&rsquo;t a public process, and the last thing I want is &ldquo;feedback&rdquo; from anonymous guys on my blog.</p>
<p>And thanks for the link ðŸ™‚</p>
<p>Best,</p>
<p>B.</p>

<p>Hello Daniel, I have been lurking on your blog for a couple months and I value your perspective as a professional academic. I wanted to introduce myself and share my perspective.</p>
<p>I consider myself to be a &ldquo;research blogger&rdquo;, or, one who publicly shares their shaky new ideas. Every time I write an entry on my blog, I feel a twinge of fear that a bigger and stronger scientist might come and quash my ideas before they&rsquo;ve really bloomed. But somehow, I am able to continue blogging. I suspect it&rsquo;s because I have little to lose. For me, my research is a hobby whose continuation does not depend on previous success.</p>

<p>@Stephanie</p>
<p>How many pictures of yourself do you have on your web site? ðŸ˜‰ It is cute (in a good way). I can reassure you: you can be a mom and a great researcher at the same time!</p>
<p>I think that research, like any other &ldquo;serious&rdquo; occupation is emotional. A lot of money and recognition is at stake.</p>
<p>In 2002, I presented a rather benign paper at some mathematical conference. My paper and my presentation were rather boring, I think&#8230; but I had people yell at me&#8230; I had people all red out of rage. Yet, all I did was to present theorems, and plot functions. I did not even try to upset people. My tone was never out of line. I was perfectly rigorous.</p>
<p>Reading your blog, I can see that you go through various emotions with respect to your research. I think that all graduate students (or prospective graduate students) go through very intense emotions regarding their research. But it does not stop there: the competition for professorship is fierce. Fighting for tenure is hard. Fighting for research grant can be very hard.</p>
<p>There is no denying that emotions play a very important role in research productivity. Do you pick a daring research topic, or do you stick with a boring but safe research topic? These are highly emotional questions&#8230; even when you have job security.</p>

<p>Ha, ha &#8212; I get a lot of comments about my snapshot roll. Maybe it&rsquo;s my way of showing that I&rsquo;m having fun, too, while researching! As you say, emotions are an important part of research.</p>

<p>Well, Gilles Brassard and Alain Tapp come to mind. Note that they share thoughts verbally. I should also add that they spent long hours alone in silence in front of a desk. Best of both worlds?</p>
<p>As for sharing research ideas in writing, nobody that I&rsquo;ve met except for Stephen Downes. Edsger W. Dijkstra might be an example, though his EWD manuscripts contained complete lines of thought (most of the time). They were often bite-sized insights, though.</p>
