title: "A Simplified Open Publishing Manifesto"
---



Bill Gasarch is proposing a [manifesto](http://blog.computationalcomplexity.org/2009/10/journal-manifesto-20.html) on Open Scholarship. What a great idea! Imagine thousands of researchers openly agreeing on practices __making research more effective!__ We could __change the culture of scientific research__ without having to convince publishers or funding agencies.

To keep the ball rolling, here is my version:

1. Whenever you publish a paper in a conference or journal, post it on your website __or__ on some appropriate archive (such as [arXiv](http://arxiv.org/)). In particular, __a____s soon as you submit__ the final version to a conference it should go on online.
1. Post improvements and revisions to your work. Should you spot a mistake in one of your older research paper, revise it and post the result online!
1. If you give a talk, then post the slides online.
1. Make it easy for other researchers to get automatic updates when you post new content. (If you use arXiv, it comes for free if you claim an [arXiv user ID](http://arxiv.org/help/author_identifiers).)
