title: "Some shameful facts about myself"
---



- In 2003, I predicted that it would take decades before videoconferencing became cheap enough for home users.
- I do not know my own telephone number or postal code, though I have lived for many years in the same house (and we own it). I do not know my office number. I do not know my social insurance number.- For the longest time, I thought that getting a Ph.D. was sufficient to get decent jobs, if not within academia, at least in industry. ([That&rsquo;s wrong](https://www.amazon.com/PhD-Not-Enough-Survival-Science/dp/0201626632).)
- Once I file anything in a folder or inside a desk, I am certain never to find it again. Anything not directly on my desk is lost forever. I am not kidding. That is why I run a paperless office.
- I once thought that computing the [Hamming distance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hamming_distance) took quadratic time.
- I can no longer understand my older research papers such as &ldquo;Fourier analysis of 2-point Hermite interpolatory subdivision schemes&rdquo; and &ldquo;A family of 4-point dyadic multistep subdivison schemes&rdquo;. I cannot even understand the abstract of these papers. I could not prove I wrote them.
- I lost all the electronic copies of my Ph.D. thesis the same day I sent the second revised version to the printer. Though I had backups, I overwrote all the backups with an empty file, by accident. Had they requested a second round of revisions, I would have had to retype my thesis.
- My wife is much smarter than I am. If she did not manage our money, I would probably put all my savings in a checking account or I might forget where the money is.
- I am somewhat of a diva: I guard my schedule against intrusions as if time spent on my research was very important. I am convinced that my research matters.
