Michael Nielsen has an excellent post today: <a title="Permanent Link: Three myths about scientific peer review" rel="bookmark" href="http://michaelnielsen.org/blog/three-myths-about-scientific-peer-review/">Three myths about scientific peer review</a>. The myths are:

- __Scientists have always used peer review__: it seems it became widespread only during the second half of the XX<sup>th</sup> century.
- __Peer review is reliable__. In fact, we know litte about the reliability of the current peer review system. How do you know how many innovations were suppressed by peer review? Any experienced scientist knows that work rejected by a peer-reviewed journal can be of high importance and high quality.
- __Peer review is the way we determine what&rsquo;s right and wrong in science__. Of course, that is very wrong. I routinely rely on work which appeared on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/), whether it has been peer reviewed or not. I also routinely ignore or dismiss peer-reviewed papersâ€”often because I determine the paper to be wrong.


If you read the reactions to Michael&rsquo;s post, you find Peter Turney&rsquo;s response:

> I&rsquo;m sympathetic to much of what you&rsquo;re saying, but, on the other hand, I know that peer review has immensely improved many of my own papers.


__My take__: I entirely agree with Peter Turney. Many of my papers benefited tremendously from peer reviewed. I could not imagine doing my work without getting feedback from my peers! However, peer review is an [honor-based system](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/blog/archives/2008/08/21/peer-review-is-an-honor-based-system/). It is meant to help the authors get a sense for the value of their work, and help them improve. You can cheat the system. And people do it routinely to get promotions and jobs.
