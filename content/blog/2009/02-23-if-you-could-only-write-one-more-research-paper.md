title: "If you could only write one more research paper&#8230;"

- If you had only one year left to live, what would you do differently?
- What are you waiting for to make these changes, now?


Let me propose a variant for researchers:

- If you could only write one more research paper, what would you write?
- Why aren&rsquo;t you writing it?
