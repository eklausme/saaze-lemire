<p>The bluffs along the seacoast in south Orange County consist of an easily erodible material, something like a sort of soft sandstone. At least to my eye, the patterns of erosion due to rain and wind are unlike erosion due to waves. </p>
<p>What has always puzzled me is the first few meters of height look like wave-erosion. Most places along the beach, waves do not reach the bluffs. Given the easily erodible material, seems that rain-erosion would erase past wave-erosion over time.</p>
<p>About the time scale, this is outside my area of knowledge.</p>
<p>Still, a sea level two meters higher a mere four thousand years back, would seem to fit with what I see.</p>
