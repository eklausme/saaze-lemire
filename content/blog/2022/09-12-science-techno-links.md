1. A standard dataset in artificial-intelligence research has [ten percent of its images mislabeled](http://arxiv.org/abs/2208.11695).[ Yet state-of-the-art algorithms achieve better-than-90% classification on the same dataset](https://paperswithcode.com/sota/image-classification-on-imagenet).

1. Despite the reeducation camps and the massive trauma, [families that did well before the Chinese socialist revolution are still doing well](https://www.nber.org/papers/w27053). In other words, it is difficult and maybe impossible to do away with the competitiveness of some families.
1. [Exercise appears to enhance the hippocampus](https://www.cell.com/iscience/fulltext/S2589-0042(21)01421-8) (in mice) so that exercise might enhance spatial learning.
1. Lead is a toxic substance that might have accounted for a significant fraction of violent crimes. [The more careful use of lead explains in part the reduction in violent crimes over time](https://www.gla.ac.uk/media/Media_774797_smxx.pdf).
1. [Watching a video at 2x the speed can double your learning speed](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/abs/10.1002/acp.3899).
1. [A man who received a heart transplant from a pig died two months later](https://www.thesun.co.uk/news/17900509/david-bennett-sr-pig-heart-transplant/).
1. Mental speed does not decrease with age as we expected: [no mental speed decline is observed before the age of 60](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41562-021-01282-7).
1. [Marmots appear not to age while they are hibernating](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/marmots-and-the-secret-to-longevity).
1. It is often stated that twins raised apart have a striking similarity in intelligence. And twins raised apart are similar in many ways (e.g., personality), but [their intelligence might be less closely related than we thought](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0191886922001477).
1. [The widespread availability of guns makes lynching less likely](https://static1.squarespace.com/static/5329e895e4b09fd4786211a3/t/630fbb4e4f9bff75800df7eb/1661975378553/Guns_under_Jim_Crow_8_4_22.pdf).
1. [Vitamin D supplements do not appear to protect the elderly against fractures](https://www.nejm.org/doi/pdf/10.1056/NEJMoa2202106).
1. [The largest flood in the history of California happened in 1862](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Great_Flood_of_1862). The flood followed a 20-year-long drought and the valleys became seas for a short time. Such a flood appears to be a relatively common occurrence though there has been no comparable flood since then. Native Americans apparently knew of these floods:<br/>

> Native Americans knew that the Sacramento Valley could become an inland sea when the rains came. Their storytellers described water filling the valley from the Coast Range to the Sierra.
