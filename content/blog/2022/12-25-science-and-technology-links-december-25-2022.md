- OpenAI made public a new tool called ChatGPT. [It is widely regarding as a practical breakthrough in artificial intelligence](https://hbr.org/2022/12/chatgpt-is-a-tipping-point-for-ai). Given a question, it can produce a coherent essay-length answer. Last week, my employer held a meeting to discuss how it will impact college classes. [OpenAI expects to make a billion dollars in 2024 with ChatGPT](https://www.reuters.com/business/chatgpt-owner-openai-projects-1-billion-revenue-by-2024-sources-2022-12-15/).
- [The US governments redistribute a greater share of the national income to low-income groups than any European country](https://www.aeaweb.org/articles?id=10.1257/app.20200703).
- [People who report being good looking also report having a more meaningful life](https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/full/10.1080/17439760.2022.2155222).
- [Mushrooms might be highly effective against depression](https://www.nejm.org/doi/full/10.1056/NEJMoa2206443).
- Inside our microprocessors, we have very fast memory used for &lsquo;caches&rsquo;, so that repeatedly accessed data is readily available. For that purpose, chips vendor use SRAM technology. SRAM is very fast but also relatively expensive. Over time, we are generally able to make processors ever more denser and thus, we can design more powerful processors for more or less a fixed cost. Having more memory on the processor is a key ingredient for better performance. Sadly, [it appears that SRAM density is no longer improving](https://fuse.wikichip.org/news/7343/iedm-2022-did-we-just-witness-the-death-of-sram/).
- For the first time in history, [we have produced more energy through fusion than we put in](https://theconversation.com/why-fusion-ignition-is-being-hailed-as-a-major-breakthrough-in-fusion-a-nuclear-physicist-explains-196475). Sadly, the overall process is still inefficient and we still need an improvement by at least a factor of ten in the efficiency.
- People of higher status are more likely to adhere strictly by medical recommandations, except for doctors themselves and the doctors&rsquo;s families. [Doctors appear to follow superior guidelines that they privately share solely with their families](https://news.mit.edu/2022/physicians-medicine-guidelines-1215). For example, doctors prescribe themselves superior antibiotics.
- There is no correlation between intelligence and belief in climate change. Rather, [belief in climate change appears to be dictated by politics](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0001691822002906).
- [Intermittent fasting reverses type-2 diabetes](https://academic.oup.com/jcem/advance-article-abstract/doi/10.1210/clinem/dgac661/6888005).
- [We may print hair follicle directly on the scap](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/36244245/). It works in mice.
- [Lifting weights reduces your mortality rate](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35599175/), from all causes including cancer and cardiovascular. It appears that 60 minutes of training per week is optimal.
- [Eating too much fiber can cause intestinal inflammation](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35881465/).
