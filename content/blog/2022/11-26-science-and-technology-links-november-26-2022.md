1. In Molière&rsquo;s famous play, Tartuffe, the main characters is outwardly pious but fundamentally deceitful. Are people who insist on broadcasting their high virtue better people, or are they more like Tartuffe? [Dong et al. (2022)](https://bpspsychub.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/bjop.12608) conclude that people who say that they have good values are not necessarily better people in practice, but they are more likely to be hypocrites. That is, Tartuffe is a realistic character. It is worth pointing out that Molière&rsquo;s play was censored by the king.
1. The thymus is a small organ which plays a critical role in your immune system by producing T cells. As you get older, your thymus nearly disappears. The net result is that by the time you are 60 years old, you have few available T cells left and your immune system cannot adapt to new diseases as well. [Calum Chace reports on a small clinical trial that showed that we can rejuvenate the thymus inexpensively](https://www.forbes.com/sites/calumchace/2022/11/01/regenerating-the-thymus-profile-of-greg-fahy/). Unfortunately, though the clinical trial has been completed years ago, nobody seems to care about what is possibly a medical breakthrough in the fight against aging.
