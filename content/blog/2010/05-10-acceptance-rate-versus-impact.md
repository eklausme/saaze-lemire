Should you attend the most selective school? Maybe not:

> Students who attended more selective colleges do not earn more than other students who were accepted and rejected by comparable schools but attended less selective colleges. (Dale and Krueger, [Estimating the payoff to attending a more selective college](https://ideas.repec.org/p/nbr/nberwo/7322.html), 1999).


Should you present papers in the conference with the lowest acceptance rate? Looking at this plot, there seems to be little correlation between acceptance rate and [impact factor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impact_factor):

__Conclusion:__ The best schools or the best conferences may not be those with low acceptance rates.
