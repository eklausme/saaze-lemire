title: "Remarkable scientists without a wikipedia page"
---



I was surprised today to learn that Michael Ley&rsquo;s wikipedia page [had been deleted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ley) (because it failed to indicate the significance of the subject). I have yet to meet anyone in Computer Science or Information Technology who does not know about the [DBLP Computer Science Bibliography](http://dblp.uni-trier.de/db/index.html). Michael has received numerous prestigious awards for his work. He is a remarkable pioneer.

But there are other remarkable people without a wikipedia page. [Patrick O&rsquo;Neil](http://www.cs.umb.edu/~poneil/) is another good example. Consider the citations that some of his papers received (according to Google Scholar):

- The dangers of replication and a solution: cited 1036 times;
- The LRU-K page replacement algorithm for database disk buffering: cited 515 times;
- Improved query performance with variant indexes: cited 421 times;
- ORDPATHs: insert-friendly XML node labels: cited 273 times.


Chances are that if you have ever used a database engine at all, it implemented an algorithm or a technique related to the O&rsquo;Neil&rsquo;s work.

How many other remarkable scientists don&rsquo;t have a wikipedia page?

__Update__: Thanks to [Ragib Hasan](http://www.ragibhasan.com/) and [David Eppstein](http://www.ics.uci.edu/~eppstein/), these two computer scientists now have wikipedia pages (see [Ley](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Michael_Ley) and [O&rsquo;Neil](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Patrick_O%27Neil)).
