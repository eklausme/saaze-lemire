<p>It would be a good thing to add articles on these people when you discuver their absence, rather than just complaining that they should be there √¢‚Ç¨‚Äù see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Be_bold</a></p>
<p>But, when doing so, it is important to include some indication of what accomplishments or recognition the subject has that would justify an article on them (according to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Notability_(academics)</a>). For instance, here is the full text of the article on Ley when it was deleted in 2006:</p>
<p>&ldquo;Michael Ley is a lecturer at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Trier (Germany). His primary interests are database systems, information retrieval, digital libraries and electronic publishing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s nothing in there that says that he was the principle developer of DBLP, nor that (as <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Bibliography_%26_Library_Project" rel="nofollow ugc">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_Bibliography_%26_Library_Project</a> says) he won two awards for this work. If there had been, the article might have been saved.</p>

<p>@Downes and @Eppstein</p>
<p>Good points.</p>
<p>Interestingly, I have exactly two comments on this post, both by people already on wikipedia:</p>

<p>I have long been opposed to the policy of simply deleting pages is the new editors-that-delete (as opposed to editors-that-create) decide the subject wasn&rsquo;t important enough. But apparently Wikipedia has decided that part of its mandate is decide who the top 1 percent (or whatever) of people in the world are.</p>
<p>In the never-never-land that is my future where I have spare time for such a project I want to create &lsquo;Wikiography&rsquo; &#8211; a wiki containing biographies, one page for each and every person that ever lived. Enough elitism; there&rsquo;s no reason why we can&rsquo;t have seven billion active, and maybe an equal number of deceased, biography pages. None whatsoever.</p>

<p>I went ahead and recreated the article with the award info. As David mentioned and I told you earlier on FB, Ley&rsquo;s article was deleted back in 2006 because it had only 1 or two sentences without signifying why he is notable. </p>
<p>The article is still quite short &#8230; so if anyone knows more information, they should add it there.</p>
<p>(Disclaimer, I don&rsquo;t have an article on myself, and have salted the page so that no one else can create it üôÇ )</p>

<p>Is DBLP really a significant scientific contribution? Even if it is, is it enough to make Ley a significant scientist? His nearly blank Wikipedia page suggests not. The correct way to do this is to mention the author Ley on the DBLP Wikipedia page, as it done now. I will delete Ley&rsquo;s page now.</p>

<p>@NotARealAdmin </p>
<p><em>Is DBLP really a significant scientific contribution?</em></p>
<p>Maybe we could discuss whether Ley is a scientist, or rather a digital librarian. I would be fine with this discussion.</p>
<p>However, building DBLP is harder than it looks. Also consider that when he started this out, he was well ahead of his time. It is easy now to look back on it and consider DBLP as a trivial thing. But, while we are at it, aren&rsquo;t HTTP and HTML trivial too?</p>
<p>Anyhow, he received multiple prestigious awards for his work. The discussion has been carried out and sane people have declared him worthy of mention.</p>
