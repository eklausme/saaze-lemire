title: "How do we choose research journals?"
---



The publishing house Elsevier invited me to fill out a survey regarding their journals. As a reward, they gave me a glimpse at their statistics.

The three most important considerations when choosing a research journals are (in order) :

1. Speed of review process
1. Standard of reviews
1. Overall reputation of the journal


And the activity researchers complained to most about? Peer reviewing manuscripts.

In any case, if you want to build a good journal and attract great papers, make sure you have fast and competent peer review. (Duh!) Meanwhile, having a good printer or a good editorial board are much less important.
