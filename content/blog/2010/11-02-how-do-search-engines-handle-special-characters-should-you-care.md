title: "How do search engines handle special characters? Should you care?"
---



[Matt Cutts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matt_Cutts) is Google&rsquo;s search engine optimization expert. He runs a great YouTube channel called [Google Webmaster Central](https://www.youtube.com/user/GoogleWebmasterHelp). He was recently [asked](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=suTDT6-Q8NE) how Google handles special characters such as [ligatures](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Typographic_ligature), [soft hyphens](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/shy.html), [interpuncts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Interpunct) and [hyphenation points](http://www.cs.tut.fi/~jkorpela/shy.html#unicode). His answer? He doesn&rsquo;t know.

Being a scientist, I decided to compare Google to the young upstart ([Bing](https://www.bing.com/)).  Using Google, the result sets from __Kurt Goedel__ differ from those with __Kurt GÃ¶del__. For example, I could only find the Kurt Goedel article from the [uncyclopedia](http://uncyclopedia.wikia.com/wiki/Kurt_Goedel) when searching for Kurt Goedel. Similarly, Google fails to realize that cÅ“ur and coeur are the same words. However, Bing knows that Goedel and GÃ¶del is the same person. Bing knows that cÅ“ur and coeur is the same word.

While the consequences are small, they are nevertheless real:

- Students may fail to find great references on Kurt GÃ¶del because they search for Kurt Goedel. Indeed, most academic papers seem to prefer GÃ¶del to Goedel.
- A writer who tries to be typographically correct and writes cÅ“ur may get penalized when people search for coeur.


__Score:__ Bing 1. Google 0.
