title: "Is programming &#8220;technical&#8221;?"
---



According to student evaluations, most of my students appreciate short programming assignments. Yet, every year, some students think that programming is below them or unimportant.

Maybe I should start my courses with this theorem:

> __Theorem. __If you understand an idea, you can implement it in software.


There is no denying that programming requires a lot of technical knowledge. Most programmers do technical jobs, involving testing, building or refactoring code. But programming is ultimately a communication form. And it is as noble as Mathematics or English. Let us compare:

- Writers are considered sexy and non-technical people. Yet, grammar and spelling are technical. Moreover, most writers earn a living by writing ads for boring products. Some of them make a living with grand novels, but fewer than you think.
- Physicists are great thinkers. Yet, their mathematical derivations are often mind-numbing and technical. Many physicists spend years running extremely technical experiments. And when they don&rsquo;t, they program extremely complex (and technical) simulations.


For some reason, being a writer is somehow considered more prestigious than being a programmer. If you ask me, [Linus Torvalds](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linus_Torvalds) is every bit asÂ cool [J. K. Rowling](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/J._K._Rowling). And I&rsquo;d rather have a lunch date with Linus.
