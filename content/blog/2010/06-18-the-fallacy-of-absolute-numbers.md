title: "The fallacy of absolute numbers"
---



I often come across the following type of arguments in research papers:

- You could save 3 bits of storage for every value in your database. Surely that&rsquo;s irrelevant. Nobody cares about saving 3 bits!
- You can sort arrays in 10 ms. Surely, that cannot be improved upon? You are already down to 10 ms and nobody cares about such small delays.


I hope you can see what is wrong with these statements?

I call it theÂ __fallacy of absolute numbers:__ you express a measure or a gain in absolute value, and then conclude to optimality or near optimality because the number appears small (or large).

__Remember:__ Saving 3 bits of storage out of 6 bits is a 2:1 compression ratio. Sorting in 5 ms instead of 10 ms doubles the speed.

__Note:__ I am sure that someone else has documented this fallacy, but I could not find any reference to it.
