title: "Write good papers: my slides"
---



I agreed to give a talk to graduate students on how to write good research papers. I have posted the [slides of my talk](https://speakerdeck.com/lemire/write-good-papers) online.
What annoys you about research papers? How do you recognize a good research paper? Do you have any advice to share?
