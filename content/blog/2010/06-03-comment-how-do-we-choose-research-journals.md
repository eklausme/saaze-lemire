<p>In my opinion you can&rsquo;t really expect to have a nice job from the peer reviewers unless you decide to do a radical change and pay them for their work.<br/>
As with everything, you get what you pay for. You know, I quite agree with the second panel of <a href="http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1200" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/archive.php?comicid=1200</a> to with respect.</p>

<p>Federico Poloni is absolutely right; I have never understood the system in which we give our results of hard and expensive research away for free; they have them reviewed for free; and then they start selling them to everybody for an awful lot of money</p>

<p>I disagree with Federico Poloni and Olivier&rsquo;s comments. It is misleading to expect that paid reviewers will perform better work than unpaid ones. As an (unpaid!) editorial board member of one of Elsevier&rsquo;s journal (an reviewer for some others), the actual (perfectible) publishing system is the only way to filter out irrelevant work and maintain standard quality you could expect from a decent research journal. You can&rsquo;t expect that from other publishing system (open-source, etc.) Paying reviewers won&rsquo;t do any good and would result in an increase in subscription cost of the whole research journals community. As a reader of such high-valued publications, are you willing to pay more for your subscriptions?</p>

<p>Although this is a little old, it still sounds true to me:<br/>
