title: "The five most important algorithms?"
---



Bernhard Koutschan posted a compilation of the [most important algorithms](http://www.risc.jku.at/people/ckoutsch/stuff/e_algorithms.html). The goal is to determine the 5 most important algorithms. Out of his list, I would select the following five algorithms:

- [Binary search](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_search_algorithm) is the first non-trivial algorithm I remember learning.
- The [Fast Fourier transform (FFT)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fast_Fourier_transform) is an amazing algorithm. Combined with the [Convolution theorem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convolution_theorem), it lets you do magic.
- While [hashing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function) is not an algorithm, it is one of the most powerful and useful idea in Computer Science. It takes minutes to explain it, but years to master.
- [Merge sort](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merge_sort) is the most elegant sorting algorithm. You can explain it in three sentences to anyone.
- While not an algorithm per se, the [Singular Value Decomposition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Singular_Value_Decomposition) (SVD) is the most important Linear Algebra concept <em>I don&rsquo;t remember learning as an undergraduate</em>. (And yes, I went to a [good school](http://www.math.toronto.edu/). And yes, I was an A student.) It can help you [invert singular matrices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoinverse) and do other similar magic.
