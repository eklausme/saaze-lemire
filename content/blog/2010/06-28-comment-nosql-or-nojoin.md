<p>Thanks for the overview on NoSQL. I&rsquo;m not convinced that imposing a strict structure on data or even how we access it is suitable for all circumstances, even though it seems that as an industry and a research field, we seem to have convinced ourselves that it is.</p>
<p>@Olivier: I don&rsquo;t find the spam protection elitist at all. If Daniel wanted elitists, he&rsquo;d ask questions only researchers could answer.</p>

<p>This is one thing I keep failing to understand. Every database-powered application I have ever written, SQL or not, a join has been necessary at some point. If it&rsquo;s a no join database, then I have to write the join in my application, by hand. </p>
<p>I would assume that the writers of such databases as PostgreSQL and MySQL are much better than I am. Their join should definitely be faster and better than my join. Therefore, what&rsquo;s the benefit of using a nojoin database if I have an application that requires joins? And if every application requires joins, what&rsquo;s the point of ever using a nojoin database?</p>
<p>Now for the hardest question. What if the join I wrote in my application using a nojoin database is somehow faster than the ones in MySQL and Postgres? In that case, why do we even need join databases at all? And why don&rsquo;t the nojoin databases add a join command?</p>

<p><i>If it&rsquo;s a no join database, then I have to write the join in my application.</i></p>
<p>No, it is not necessarily true. If you don&rsquo;t normalize, you may not need a join. Second, a join can be precomputed. Third, a relational DB is a compromise (OLTP vs retrieval) solution. If you don&rsquo;t need all fancy transaction staff you can do much better.</p>

<p>Nice article. On this topic, I have a question which I have been trying to figure out for some time now. Whenever someone looks into NoSQL as a means to avoid costly join operations, there is usually a suggestion of using column-oriented databases (like HBase or Cassandra) to fix that issue. I&rsquo;ve been thinking for quite some time on how column-oriented should be able to fix expensive join operations and I haven&rsquo;t figured it out. Anyone care to enlighten me?</p>

<p>Hm is that it? I know Cassandra also allows you to have more than one value on the same field (sorry if the terminology is not correct), which allows you to avoid many-to-many relationships therefore avoiding join operations.</p>

<p>@André Silva<br/>
Yes, it does not require normalization, which, can also be seen as a precomputed join.</p>
<p>In addition, I believe that some of the column-oriented DBs work with compacted semi-static data. At least, BigTable does. </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t remember how they handle transactions, I just remember that their data is mostly static. Therefore, it can be compressed and retrieved efficiently.</p>

<p>Interesting article; I found this point a bit puzzling though:</p>
<p>&ldquo;SQL is based on joins and related low-level issues like foreign keys&rdquo;.</p>
<p>I think when it comes to models and languages for discussing data, many would agree that the relational model (and SQL, as an approximation of it) is *higher-level* than object-based database models. The model is purer and works at a higher level of abstraction, not being concerned with lower-level optimisations for particular physical storage layouts and data access paths, but instead modelling the data declaratively in a very pure flexible normalised form without redundancies.</p>
<p>Also: SQL is declarative language &#8211; be careful to distinguish &lsquo;join&rsquo; as a logical expression in a declarative language, and the implementation techniques used by some DMBSes to compute these joins. DBMSes are by no means compelled to use any one technique to compute a query. Sometimes they need to be given hints. But it&rsquo;s worth separating the logical model from the physical storage model and any physical storage optimisations, at least in your mind when reasoning about these concepts.</p>

<p>NoSQL systems could do joins (in principle) but they can&rsquo;t garantuee its consistency. </p>
<p>So &ldquo;they&rdquo; say that if you want to do a join you have to do it in the application. Doing a join in the application is always slower because it means that you have to call the db twice instead of once. There is also a greater change of inconsistency because stuff can change between the first call and the second call to the db. </p>
<p>It is all about who the problem owner is when it comes to inconsistency? The database or the application? </p>
<p>Cassandra (R + W &gt; N) only offers consistency when you retrieve one &ldquo;record&rdquo;. Oracle offers consistency when you retrieve one, two or a million (aggregation) records. </p>
<p>Cassandra and MongoDB &ldquo;records&rdquo; can contain a lot of information so there is less need to join. </p>
