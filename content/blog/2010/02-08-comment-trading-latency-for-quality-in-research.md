<p>Great initiative, I&rsquo;m curious to see how it works out!</p>
<p>W.r.t. to plagiarism: I don&rsquo;t think direct plagiarism will be a problem, as it is will be obvious that the ideas were published here first. There&rsquo;s no problem with arXiv pre-prints either. Besides, the readers of this blog are your witnesses ðŸ™‚</p>

<p>@Jonathan</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s a good point. </p>
<p>But I think that it is not a problem if you are the primary author of the paper in question and you are willing to share the credit.</p>
<p>But, yeah, I expect to have to think this through some more as I do it.</p>

<p>Cool. would like to see about the result.<br/>
But what about the risk of plagarism of unpublished works ?</p>

<p>Hi Daniel, it is a good idea,<br/>
I think that you could also crosspost to<br/>
<a href="http://www.pubzone.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.pubzone.org/</a><br/>
PS: I don&rsquo;t think palgiarism would be a problem. No decent scientist would publish somebody else&rsquo;s paper. Besides, if it is an experimental one, you need software to reproduce results. That is you can be easily caught and banned from the scientific community.</p>

<p>One thing to consider is what happens if a paper is improved substantially by comments on the blog. This could also result in 20-author papers. Not necessarily a bad thing for science, but something to think about.</p>

<p>Johnatan,<br/>
Though I would share some of your concern, but &#8230; reviewers do improve the quality of the paper and often considerably, but that does not make them co-authors. The primary goal of such an exposure is to find errors.</p>

<p>@Geoff Several papers have been written using wikis and blogs. See for example:</p>
<p><a href="http://polymathprojects.org/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://polymathprojects.org/</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not sure it has been wildly successful yet, but we are still at the early stages.</p>
<p>And I would certainly participate in such a project if I found one that was a good match for my research interests. And I hope I will one day.</p>

<p>@Itman What about indecent scientists?</p>
<p>Has there been attempts at authoring a paper using something like a wiki, or is that maybe going too far?</p>
<p>Regardless, I&rsquo;m all for this experiment.</p>

<p>The problem is that sometimes people are &ldquo;measured&rdquo; for the quantity of papers they publish. Specially here in Brazil, where the number of papers you write can change the salary you get.</p>
<p>That is why we sometimes have lots of bad quality works here &#8230;</p>

<p>The Polymath project relied mainly on blogs, much like what Daniel proposes; for details, see the October 2009 <a href="http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v461/n7266/full/461879a.html" rel="nofollow"><i>Nature</i> article</a> by Tim Gowers and Michael Nielsen, the two main players in the project. In that sense, it was not exactly collaborative writing: someone had to put together all the pieces and actually write the paper.Authorship was one of the issues in the project; see <a href="https://gowers.wordpress.com/2009/01/27/is-massively-collaborative-mathematics-possible/" rel="nofollow"><i>Is massively collaborative mathematics possible</i></a> on Tim Gower&rsquo;s blog. The first paper produced through this project, which is still at the <a href="http://arxiv.org/PS_cache/arxiv/pdf/0910/0910.3926v2.pdf" rel="nofollow">preprint</a> stage, uses a pseudonym, D.H.J. Polymath, without giving the name of any of the 27 contributors. Even if it&rsquo;s technically possible to evaluate individual contributions (espectially if a wiki is used instead of blogs), one can easily understand that this collaboration mode could be deemed inappropriate by many (especially junior researchers) in the &ldquo;publish or perish&rdquo; culture.</p>
<p>A different so-called &ldquo;next-generation&rdquo; wiki (see <a href="http://www.mememoir.org/" rel="nofollow">http://mememoir.org</a>), which &ldquo;links every word to its corresponding author&rdquo; has been proposed to address this issue. It seems to have been used only in one project, called <a href="http://www.wikigenes.org" rel="nofollow">wikigenes</a>, which doesn&rsquo;t aim at producing scientific papers. Thus, to my knowlodge, we have still to see an example of an entirely wiki-based collaborative production of a scientific paper, starting from scratch.</p>
