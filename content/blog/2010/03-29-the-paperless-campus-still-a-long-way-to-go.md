Today I spent money from a research grant.Â Here is the process:

1. I grab the form in Excel format.
1. I fill it out.
1. I print the form.
1. I sign it.
1. I give it to a secretary.
1. The secretary gets the chair of my research center to sign it.
1. The form is then sent to accounting, by internal mail (on paper).
1. They review the form.
1. They enter the data in a computerized database.


Suggesting that it could be improved using <span style="text-decoration: underline;">technology from this century</span> is __crazy talk__.
