<p>Would you say it is only related to math researchers??</p>
<p>I think it depends also in the capability of each person, someone who managed to write more than 4 Journal Papers in their PhD&rsquo;s maybe would not have any problem at all.</p>

<p>Supply and demand &#8211; employers would like to pay as little as possible for educated employees. Thus the regular &ldquo;studies&rdquo; that proclaim dire shortages of engineers/scientists, even when the job market sucks.</p>
<p>None of this has changed since before *I* went to college &#8211; more than 30 years back.</p>

<p>(1) It is not limited to Mathematics. In fact, the reference I point to states that things were better in Mathematics than most fields. </p>
<p>(2) Writing four good research articles during your Ph.D. years might help you find a job, but people with 15 or 20 research articles routinely fail to get jobs.</p>
<p>(3) Yes, the people who stand out get jobs, but standing out is a mix of different factors: luck, talent, work, nurture, support, and so on.</p>
<p>(4) And not all jobs are created equal. Excellent applicants routinely get jobs as research assistants (or the like) whereas they desserve much more. So, it is not just a matter of who is getting a job, but also, what kind of job they may get.</p>
<p>(5) And then again, there must be jobs in whatever subfield you have chosen. As some fields become fashionable, others become &ldquo;pass√©&rdquo;.</p>
<p>(6) And of course, there must be jobs in the locations where you are willing to live. If you have three kids, moving them in the middle of nowhere for a so-so job is harsh.</p>

<p>I think it is relevant right now, I just completed PhD and looked recently on job market. I have 10 conference papers and I found it is fairly difficult to get any job for PhD. For web development jobs I am overqualified, for low-level technical job possibly under qualified.</p>

<p>By experience, for each tenure-track position open, there can be an averaged of 100 post-doc applicants or more&#8230; (independently of the field)</p>
