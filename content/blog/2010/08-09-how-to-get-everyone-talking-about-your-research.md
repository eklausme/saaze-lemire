title: "How to get everyone talking about your research!"

[Deolalikar](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vinay_Deolalikar) [claims to have solved](http://www.scribd.com/doc/35539144/pnp12pt) the famous [P versus NP problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem). Is the proof correct? Some influential researchers doubt it: Scott Aaronson is [betting](http://www.scottaaronson.com/blog/?p=456) 200k$ of his own money against Deolalikar.

What I find most interesting is that Deolalikar did not submit the paper to a journal, as far as I know. He didn&rsquo;t even post it on [arxiv](http://arxiv.org/) like [Perelman](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grigori_Perelman). Yet, he is receiving much attention. [His name is being tweeted](https://mobile.twitter.com/i/guest#search?q=Deolalikar) several times a minute. Many of the most influential theoretical computer scientists are reacting to the paper. He is getting the best peer review possible. Most similar papers don&rsquo;t get so much attention.

Why is this paper different?

- Everyone seems to agree that the paper is well written, it has nice (color!) figures and the reference section appears up-to-date and complete.  __If your result is important, communicate it well.__
- Deolalikar has published just a handful of papers in theoretical computer science, and none at the major conferences. __But ____he has enough peer-reviewed research papers to be treated as a peer.__
- While I doubt he was hired to work on complexity theory, Deolalikar is an industry researcher at HP. __Being paid to do research might make you more credible__.

__Update:__ Porreca has [the best write-up](http://aeporreca.org/2010/08/09/proof-that-p-isnt-np/) on reactions to this paper.

__Update 2:__ The consensus after two weeks is that the proof wrong and unfixable.
