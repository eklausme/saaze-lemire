title: "Where to get your ebooks?"
---



If you read my blog, you probably like to read in general. Thus, if you don&rsquo;t own an ebook device, you will soon. The choice is growing: the [Amazon Kindle](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amazon_Kindle), the [Sony Reader](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sony_Reader), the [Apple iPad](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_iPad),&hellip; I bought a kindle because my wife won&rsquo;t let me fill the house with books. And I hate to throw away perfectly good paper books.

Amazon has most of the market for now. Yet, using&nbsp;the kindle storeâ€”on the kindleâ€”is painful. Moreover, Amazon ebooks are protected by&nbsp;[Digital Right Management](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Digital_rights_management) (DRM). Amazon sells you crippled ebooks that can [stop working](https://gizmodo.com/5298749/kindle-drm-surfaces-to-deny-user-the-books-hes-bought-and-paid-for) if you copy them too often. There are often better alternatives elsewhere.

And, in Canada, there is a two-dollar surcharge&nbsp;for every wireless download using the Kindle. Since most ebooks are 0.5MB or less, __the wireless costs 4$ per megabyte!__ This is insulting! Moreover, if you buy a book by mistakeâ€”which is annoying commonâ€”Amazon will reimburse the cost of the book itself, but not the fee for the wireless download.

Thankfully, you can grab books compatible with the kindle (in [Mobipocket format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mobipocket)) elsewhere. Then you can drop the file on the kindle using the USB port.

- You can get nearly 2000 of the great French classic for free on [ebookgratuits](http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/ebooks.php). This include a large fraction of the work of Honoré de Balzac.
- [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/) offers 30,000 free e-books in various languages (mostly English).
- [WebScription](http://www.webscription.net/) sells DRM-free ebooks in various format. Most books fall into the scifi, young adults and fantasy genres.


I am currently reading [You&rsquo;re Not Fooling Anyone When You Take Your Laptop to a Coffee Shop](http://www.goodreads.com/book/show/88070.You_re_Not_Fooling_Anyone_When_You_Take_Your_Laptop_to_a_Coffee_Shop_Scalzi_on_Writing) by Scalzi. [I bought it at WebScription](http://www.webscription.net/p-958-youre-not-fooling-anyone-when-you-take-your-laptop-to-a-coffee-shop.aspx) for six dollars. It is a compilation of Scalzi&rsquo;s blog posts on his life as a writer. I am fascinated by how much it ressembles my own life. Well&hellip; Except for the fact that I don&rsquo;t get paid when I publish a paper. Maybe I should put together a compilation of posts about my silly work life. Would anyone buy it for six dollars?

I am also reading [Halting State](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Halting_State) by Stross which I bought on Amazon for ten dollars. I haven&rsquo;t yet gotten into the mood of the novel.

- According to a Computer Scientist, the iPad&nbsp;[could make Computer Science obsolete](https://geomblog.blogspot.com/2010/02/could-ipad-make-computer-science.html).
- While I don&rsquo;t think academic journals will be available on the Kindle any time soon, I think that has mostly to do with how insane academic publishing is.
