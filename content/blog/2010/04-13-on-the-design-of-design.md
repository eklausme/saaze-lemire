title: "On the design of design"
---



Following a [blog post](http://www.johndcook.com/blog/2010/04/08/many-hands-make-more-work/) by John D. Cook, I started reading [Fred Brooks](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fred_Brooks)&lsquo; latest book. Brooks is famous, among other things, for his earlier book, the [Mythical Man-Month](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Mythical_Man-Month). The book is really a collection of essays, organized like blog posts. It is really engaging.

I had never read about design per se, except in [Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/)&lsquo;s essays. For me, the core message of the book is that __writing software, planning houses, writing books or poems, are very similar tasks__. The [metaheuristics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaheuristic) are the same. The lessons you must learn are similar. You are trying to solve very large NP-hard problems where you can&rsquo;t reliably divide the problem space. Systematic greedy algorithms may work, but they may also mislead you. You need some formalism, some rigor, but you also need experience, or instinct.
