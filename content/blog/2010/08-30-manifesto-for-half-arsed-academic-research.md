- __Research results are more important than the number of publications or citations__.<br/>
This is fine. Yet, we don&rsquo;t have time to readÂ your papers. So, just keep publishing a lot of papers each year. And get your influential friends to cite you. That&rsquo;s how we&rsquo;ll know whether you are good.
- __Science and truth are more important than spin and marketing.__<br/>
Yes, but keep pretending you will solve world hunger. And align your research results with the current fashionable trends.
- __You cannot tell where the next science breakthrough is going to come from.__<br/>
Maybe. Still, we want a plan of your research activities for the next five years.
