- [Emotions killing your intellectual productivity](/lemire/blog/2009/01/20/emotions-killing-your-intellectual-productivity/): We all have to deal with setbacks. And even when things go our way, we can still remain frustrated. I offer pointers on how to remain productive despite your emotional state.
- [Turn your weaknesses into strengths](/lemire/blog/2009/01/19/turn-your-weaknesses-into-strengths/): We all have weaknesses. Maybe you are unemployed. Or maybe you failed at getting a research grant. Maybe you live in a remote or poor area. I think that, within reason, many of your weaknesses can actually play in your favor if you adapt your strategy.
- [How reliable is science?](/lemire/blog/2010/09/06/how-reliable-is-science/): I got a lot of heat for this blog post. Basically, I believe that the business of science is unreliable. And I am not alone. The Nobel laureate [Harry Kroto](http://www.kroto.info/) [wrote](http://wavefunction.fieldofscience.com/2010/10/most-ludicrous-system-ever-devised.html): &ldquo;The peer-review system is the most ludicrous system ever devised. It is useless and does not make sense (&hellip;)&rdquo;. I couldn&rsquo;t agree more as my post [The hard truth about research grants](/lemire/blog/2009/09/15/the-hard-truth-about-research-grants/) makes clear.
