title: "Computer Science is shallow"
---



[Zed A. Shaw](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zed_Shaw)â€”author of several books on [Ruby](https://www.amazon.com/s?_encoding=UTF8&amp;search-alias=books&amp;field-author=Zed%20Shaw) and Pythonâ€”came up with an interesting criticism of Computer Science. He makes some good points:

> Computer Science is a pointless discipline with no culture. (&hellip;) They rarely teach deep philosophy and instead would rather either teach you what some business down the street wants, or teach you their favorite pet language like LISP. (&hellip;) Another way to explain the shallowness of Computer Science is that it&rsquo;s the only discipline that eschews paradox. Even mathematics has reams of unanswered questions and potential paradox in its core philosophy. (&hellip;) There&rsquo;s an envelope of knowledge so vast in most other disciplines that just when you think you&rsquo;ve learned it all you find something else you never knew. This is what makes them interesting.


Oh! I think there are many deep and exciting questions in Computer Science. (And not just whether [P is equal to NP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/P_versus_NP_problem).) And do Sociology, Economics and History have more depth? But I agree that Computer Science is too often [utilitarian](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utilitarianism). Some like to pretend that by catering to the perceived needs of industry, graduates will get better jobs. Unfortunately, too often, the students have to unlearn their so-called &ldquo;practical knowledge&rdquo; once they leave the campus. The honest truth: __you don&rsquo;t need three or four years of college to do great in the software industry__.

Maybe more time should be spent on the deep questions. Here are a few discussion points that come to mind :

- What is &ldquo;meaning&rdquo; and how can computation capture or codify it? What does it say about our brain? Is our brain a Turing machine?
- Why are some programmers ten times more productive than others?
- Can computers extend our intelligence? How intelligent can we become?
