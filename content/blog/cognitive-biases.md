[One-sided bet](https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2007/02/08/the_fallacy_of/): People commonly assume implicitly that their actions may only have good outcomes. For example, increasing the minimum wage in a country may only benefit the poor. Taking a lottery ticket only has the upside of possibly winning a lot of money. Believing in God can only have benefits. And so forth. In truth, most actions are two-sided. They have good and bad effects.

[Politician&rsquo;s syllogism](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Politician%27s_syllogism): We must do something, this is something so we must do it. &ldquo;We must fight climate change, we can tax oil, so we must tax oil.&rdquo; If there is a problem, it is important to assess the actions we could take and not believe that because they are actions in response to a real problem, they are intrinsically good.

[Confirmation bias](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Confirmation_bias): &ldquo;I believe that there are extraterrestrials, I have collected 1000 reports confirming their presence&rdquo; (but I am blind to all of the negative evidence). People tend to make up their mind first and then to seek to rationalize their opinion whereas they should do the opposite.

[Historical pessimism bias](https://www.amazon.com/Better-Angels-Our-Nature-Violence/dp/0143122010/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&amp;keywords=The+Better+Angels+of+Our+Nature%3A+Why+Violence+Has+Declined): &ldquo;Human life was so much better 2 centuries ago!&rdquo; Yet by almost any measure, human beings have better lives today.

[Theory of the second best](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_the_second_best): By fixing one problem, we may actually make overall welfare worse. Consider a mining monopoly that is also a polluter. If the government breaks up the monopoly, it may increase pollution. Thus to improve matters, it is necessary to look at the whole picture.
