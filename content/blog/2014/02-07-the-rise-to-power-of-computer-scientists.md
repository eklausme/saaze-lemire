Want to become CEO of a major technology company? Consider the background of the hot CEOs of the hour:

- Amazon: [Jeff Bezos](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jeff_Bezos) has a degree in electrical engineering and computer science.
- Apple: [Tim Cook](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Cook) got a degree in industrial engineering.
- Facebook: [Mark Zuckerberg](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Zuckerberg) studied computer science.
- Google: [Larry Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Larry_Page) has a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science.
- Microsoft: [Satya Nadella](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Satya_Nadella) has a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science.
- Twitter: [Dick Costolo](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dick_Costolo) has a degree in computer and communication sciences.
- Yahoo!: [Marissa Mayer](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marissa_Mayer) has a master&rsquo;s degree in computer science.


My discussions with students suggest that many want a technology or computer science degree as an entry point to higher level jobs. That is, they don&rsquo;t study computer science in college to become programmers&hellip; rather they want the degree to secure leadership positions.
