title: "Science: ideals vs. reality"

Fernando PÃ©rez gave a [talk at Pycon 2014](http://www.pyvideo.org/video/2683/keynote-fernando-perez) with a brilliant slide:

> The <del>ideals</del> reality of science:

- The pursuit of <del>verifiable answers</del> highly cited papers for your c.v.
- The validation of our results by <del>reproduction</del> convincing referees who did not see your code or data
- <del>An altruistic, collective enterprise</del> A race to outrun your colleagues in front of the giant bear of grant funding
