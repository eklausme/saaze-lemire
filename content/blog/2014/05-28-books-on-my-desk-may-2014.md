- Manning sent me the second edition of their [Hello World: Computer Programming for Kids and Other Beginners](/lemire/blog/archives/2009/08/07/a-review-of-hello-world-computer-programming-for-kids-and-other-beginners/). [At less than $25 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Hello-World-Computer-Programming-Beginners/dp/1617290920/), this 450-page color book is a great deal. The first edition got raving reviews. It is a great book for any teenager who wants to learn to program.
- Princeton University Press sent me a copy of Math Bytes by Tim Chartier ([for as little as $13 on Amazon](https://www.amazon.com/Math-Bytes-Google-Chocolate-Covered-Computing-ebook/dp/B00IPSAKJK/)). It is a short, beautiful and fun book for nerds. The scope of topics is amazing. For example, what is the math behind the Angry Bird game? How would you paint a picture of Obama using M&#038;Ms? Probably a good summer book.
