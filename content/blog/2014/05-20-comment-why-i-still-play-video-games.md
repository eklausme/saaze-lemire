<p>Thanx for the recommendation. I bought it on playstation store for 13$ and so far, I am hooked. I like the gameflow where every scene flows into the next and you can&rsquo;t really stop playing because there is always something more to do. Great story so far, great immersive graphics and a great bang for the buck.</p>
<p>On a personnal note, I would recommend the Mass Effect series which left me in awe at the end of the last game. My all time best along with Deus Ex: human revolution. Bioware improved and fixed the gameplay throughout the series. The bonus missions (which you have to buy) are really worth it. A timeless masterpiece with awesome score, graphics, cinematics, deep characters, personnalized gameplay and an epic storyline comparable to the Dune series, nothing less.</p>

<p>I like Mass Effect, but I did not like the slow-motion &ldquo;boss&rdquo; at the end of Mass Effect 3. Bad way to end the game.</p>

<p>I prefer Deux Ex: Mankind Divided.</p>
