<p>I think this is *one* of many reasons why they are doing it, and frankly it solves a short term problem in exchange for a longer term one. The reality is that the storage costs for data follow a Moore-like decline over time, even as data explodes. So the long term cost for doing what they do would be, at best, less than inflation, which means while it provides a significant one-time boost in spending, in the end it becomes a reason to cut spending.</p>
<p>I think there is a far more obvious upside for budget discussions. If you&rsquo;re about to go before Congress to justify your budget, wouldn&rsquo;t *you* want to have a comprehensive history of all digital communications of everyone involved in the process, their family, their friends, and their staff? It&rsquo;d be great both for understanding how to position yourself as well as the always popular blackmail scenario. It&rsquo;d be great even if you *never looked at it*.</p>
