Google provides a ranking of research venue per domain. For [databases and information systems](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&#038;hl=en&#038;vq=eng_databasesinformationsystems), they provide the top 20 venues according to their [h-index](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/H-index).

As part of their assessment, they chose to include [arXiv](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arxiv): a repository of freely available research papers. Almost anyone can post a paper on arXiv. There is some filtering, but there is no scientific review of the papers. This means that if you download a paper from arXiv and it is complete junk, you have nobody to complain to (except the authors). 

Nevertheless, it appears that people are willing to post their great papers on arXiv. [On a ranking per h-index, the databases section of arXiv ranks in 11th place](https://scholar.google.com/citations?view_op=top_venues&#038;hl=en&#038;vq=eng_databasesinformationsystems), outranking prestigious journals like the VLDB Journal, Data &#038; Knowledge Engineering, Information Systems and Knowledge and Information Systems&hellip; not to mention all the journals and conferences that do not appear in the top-20 list provided by Google. 

One could argue that the good ranking can be explained by the fact that arXiv includes everything. However, it is far from true. There are typically less than 30 new database papers every month on arXiv whereas big conferences often have more than 100 articles (150 at SIGMOD 2013 and and over 200 at VLDB 2013). Roughly speaking, the database section of arXiv is equivalent to two big conferences while there are dozens of conferences and journals.

You can subscribe to to arXiv on Twitter. All papers are freely downloadable.
