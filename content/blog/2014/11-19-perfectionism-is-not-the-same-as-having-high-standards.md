title: "Perfectionism is not the same as having high standards"
---



A lot of what I do is&hellip; quite frankly&hellip; not very good. To put it differently, almost everything I do fails to meet my quality standards. So I am constantly fighting to do better.

It is not perfectionism. Perfectionism is the refusal to do anything unless it meets your high standards. To put it differently, perfectionism is synonymous with a lack of humility. It is a belief that flawed results are below you.

Let me be blunt: perfectionists are self-centered pretentious pricks.
