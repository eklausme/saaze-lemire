<p>That&rsquo;s a really interesting result, and somewhat surprising! I would generally expect better institutions to attract better students, which can make a big difference in doing good work. If that effect isn&rsquo;t significant, then that suggests that good researchers can attract equally good students at any location.</p>

<p>I didn&rsquo;t read their methods in detail, but it could be that moving to a better university does improve your productivity, it is just that there is an opposite regression-to-the-mean effect.</p>
<p>In order to move to a better university, a scientist has to do well. Therefore, scientists who just moved to a better university are more likely to do so after having a productive period (relative to themselves), and you would therefore expect their productivity to go down after the move (towards their true mean ability)</p>

<p>This appears to be more or less their argument&#8230; but I do not find it convincing.</p>

<p>Is &ldquo;..being a better researcher&#8230;&rdquo; quantified by the volume (i.e. frequency) of publications? (Not rhetorical &#8211; I&rsquo;m actually asking). It seems a very simplistic measure (by itself) for what a researcher does. </p>
<p>In &ldquo;the business world&rdquo; (as opposed to the &ldquo;the research world&rdquo;) the highest productivity comes from someone who is happy &#8212; plain and simple. If a person is happy with where they are and who they work with, they will have greater output of&#8230; whatever. If they are unhappy, productivity suffers (including both quantity and quality). </p>
<p>For a researcher, I would think the same to hold true. Papers are up when they are happy and down when they are not. So, if I have a researcher who I&rsquo;m moving from an environment where he&rsquo;s happy to a state-of-the-art building that has nothing but the best geniuses and Bill Gates is personally funding the facility &#8212; but the researcher hates it there, then the measure would show that moving a researcher to a &ldquo;better&rdquo; facility is less productive. </p>
<p>I would think you&rsquo;d need to control for a researcher&rsquo;s satisfaction &#8212; or choose a different measure for the productivity of a researcher.</p>

<p>@David</p>
<p>I believe that they use the number of citations per article as a quality measure.</p>

<p>Could it be that a better university has a higher rate of managerial staff (very lame translation of &ldquo;encadrement&rdquo;) so the burden of admin work is lighter, allowing the researcher to devote more time to his research?</p>

<p>@Djamé</p>
<p>I am sure larger and richer schools have more &ldquo;managerial staff&rdquo; but whether it translates into more research time&#8230; I do not know.</p>

<p>I had watched an piece of interview to Richard Feynman in which he talk about this problem with students.</p>
<p>His point was more or less this: &ldquo;If you take a brilliant guy from a modest class and you put him in a class of brilliant guys, it is very likely he won&rsquo;t sparkle any more. This is because among the brilliant guys, there is still space for only 3 of them to be super brilliant. The rest will feel sad and will go on feeling even worse than it is.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This makes somehow sense for me. To what extent it can be true for researchers too, I don&rsquo;t know. What do you think?</p>

<p>@Michele</p>
<p>I do not know. </p>
<p>However, I would say that if you are stuck in the mediocre class, you should not conclude that you are done for. I started primary school in a class for students having learning disabilities. Today, I have been a federally funded researcher in computer science for almost 15 years.</p>
<p>I was lucky, however, to work with brilliant people who raised my level.</p>

<p>I saw his answer more as a scepticism against all the forms of elitism in academy, rather than some thing else.</p>
