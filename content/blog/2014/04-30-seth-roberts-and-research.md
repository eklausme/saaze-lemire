title: "Seth Roberts and research"
---



[Seth Roberts](http://blog.sethroberts.net/) was one of my favourite bloggers. He recently passed away.
Seth was an original fellow. He completed his PhD and went on to secure a job at a leading university&hellip; only to effectively reject the academic model. He retired early.

I have exchanged a few emails with Seth over the years and was even featured on his blog once. I think I am not too far off if I describe Seth&rsquo;s principles for good research as follows&hellip;

- Be willing to spend a long time (decades) on one problem before you get results.
- Seek useful ideas, not prestige.
- Dare to attack problems as an outsider.


Was Seth a success in the end? His recent work certainly did not earn him any favours within academia. Yet I think that Ben Casnocha [expressed how many of us feel](http://casnocha.com/2014/04/rip-seth-roberts.html):

> Like many who knew him or read his stuff, I&rsquo;ll miss Seth. He was a one-of-a-kind thinker.
