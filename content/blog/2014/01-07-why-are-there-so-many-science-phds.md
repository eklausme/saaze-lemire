title: "Why are there so many science PhDs?"
---



McArdle, an economist, recently wrote that [a substantial fraction of PhD programs really shouldn&rsquo;t exist](http://www.bloombergview.com/articles/2014-01-03/can-t-get-tenure-then-get-a-real-job). McGowan goes further by pointing out that there is [little demand](http://math-blog.com/2014/01/07/new-stem-phds-and-industry/) for science and technology PhDs. [I can only agree](/lemire/blog/2013/09/23/why-cant-yo-find-a-job-with-a-stanford-computer-science-ph-d/). Meanwhile, [the gap](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2013/02/the-phd-bust-americas-awful-market-for-young-scientists-in-7-charts/273339/) between tenure-track positions and the number of new PhDs keeps on increasing. In countries like Japan, [we are facing a crisis](http://www.nature.com/news/2011/110420/full/472276a.html):

> Of the 1,350 people awarded doctorates in natural sciences in 2010, just over half (746) had full-time posts lined up by the time they graduated. But only 162 were in [academia], of the rest, 250 took industry positions, 256 went into education and 38 got government jobs.


In the US, things are getting worse and worse:

> In 1973, 55% of US doctorates in the biological sciences secured tenure-track positions within six years of completing their PhDs, and only 2% were in a postdoc or other untenured academic position. By 2006, only 15% were in tenured positions six years after graduating (&hellip;)


Even in a field like computer science, [55% all new PhDs go into industry](http://cra.org/resources/taulbee-survey/), rarely landing a research position while less than 7% end up with a tenure-track position in a doctoral-granting school.<br/>
Yet between 2000 and 2010, in the US, [the number of STEM graduate students grew by 30%](http://news.sciencemag.org/2012/06/u.s.-students-flock-graduate-science-programs). Why?

McGowan writes:

> It is not surprising that many STEM students believe there is a strong industry appetite for freshly minted Ph.D.&rsquo;s given these numerous advertising and public relations campaigns by many businesses.


McGowan provided little support for this assertion. I went looking and found nothing in the last 10 years. In fact, I ended up reading several articles warning students against graduate work&hellip;
I am left with something of a mystery&hellip; why are we producing more and more PhD students?

My thoughts:

- To a student, the PhD job market is an abstract entity. The financial incentives provided by the government (e.g., scholarships) are not.
- Even though the job prospects of a science PhD might be bad, maybe the alternatives look even worse. Yes, you can make a good living as an engineer or an accountant in industry&hellip; but maybe students imagine that the life of a PhD, no matter how difficult, is somehow more exciting?
- It might be all about status signalling. A science PhD might be a way to tell the world that you are smart. Even if employers are unimpressed, maybe your friends or prospective mates could be impressed?
- Schools and professors are misleading students. If your local dean says that there is a shortage of science PhD, are you going to check the data for yourself?


What are your thoughts?
