<p>The real game is simple- get funding.<br/>
Currently, you need to believe in global warming to get funding in climatology.<br/>
In nutrition, it is best to not believe that insulin has anything to do with getting fat, and it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to imagine that animal protein might be evil.<br/>
In agricultural science, GMO, pesticides, and oil based fertilizer not to mention the pretense that the subsidized crops are actually good for humans to eat is important for your career.<br/>
Economist are required to forget economic law immediately upon hire and instead justify the government entity that just hired them, gave them a grant, or whatever.</p>
<p>You are only going to see conformists where you are. Everyone else has to route around.</p>

<p>I actually have a different opinion. Researchers do pursue all kind of crazy ideas instead of doing things that are simple and work. And double-checking if these things are working.</p>
<p>As a result, the current stage is deplorable. For instance, in IR some people believe that proximity ranking is super-useful. But there is a tremendous opposition (including some very well-known academics) who think that this is not true.</p>
<p>The reason is that, instead of carefully trying to reproduce a result in different settings, people went along with all kind of crazy ideas.</p>

<p>PS: you won&rsquo;t get funded if (1) your idea is too old, i.e., reproduction of results is not funded (2) your idea is too novel.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a book written by Judith Schlesinger that debunks the myth of the mad genius. See the book webpage: <a href="http://www.theinsanityhoax.com/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.theinsanityhoax.com/</a> .</p>

<p>Since you put Crazy, Original, and Gardener together in one post, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think of Masanobu Fukuoka (more correctly, he was the intersection of Crazy-sounding, Authentic, and Farmer). </p>
<p>I highly recommend his book &ldquo;One Straw Revolution&rdquo;: <a href="https://www.amazon.com/The-One-Straw-Revolution-Introduction-Classics/dp/1590173139" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.amazon.com/The-One-Straw-Revolution-Introduction-Classics/dp/1590173139</a></p>
<p>As usual, I enjoy reading your posts, and look forward to seeing them in my email. Thank you.</p>

<p>I would like to add my little 2 cents to the discussion. First, I would think that highly intelligent people that are somewhat antisocial would embrace the loneliness of academic research. People who don&rsquo;t need social interaction can fully vacate to their research undisturbed. Think of all those wizkids hackers spending 20 hours + a day on their computers trying to &lsquo;solve&rsquo; those computer security puzzles (like a bank website protections) Therefore, I would say that madness can be a good starting point for genius. Especially if you have a mental condition that makes you obsessed and focused (like Asperger syndrome or other kinds of autism spectrum disorders). Similarly, chess is a maddening game for obsessive and smart people. Bobby Fisher, Paul Morphy, Rubenstein, Steinitz and Alekhine were good examples. Obsession is a great motivator that leads to hard work and it is well known that genius is mostly based on hard work. In summary, I tend to think that madness causes genius not the other way around.</p>
