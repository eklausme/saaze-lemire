<p>This interesting point of view confounds certain things about the allegorical game. Take the bit on Hugh Howey: while it&rsquo;s true that library shelf space is not the contest that matters, there still was always a contest over people&rsquo;s pocket money, and even, over people&rsquo;s entertainment time and money. Hugh Howey *did* eat the lunch of some other authors; he did displace them, if not on shelves, at least on the market. He has not invented a whole new market, he just found a very good way to compete and win.</p>
<p>The idea that the game of &ldquo;great value generation&rdquo; is open and welcoming is naive and disingenuous. Of course, the cost of entry is not that high. Still, burning out remains easy to do and is a real risk despite the more noble goal of giving the world something of worth.</p>
<p>Finally, I can&rsquo;t help but point out how you, Daniel, propose this idea of a better game from quite the position of privilege.<br/>
With all due respect, if you can bear my tickling, tenure is a pretty good net to bounce off when you&rsquo;re not doing good at the game. You must agree that winning those few zero-sum games have their perks. Enjoy your risk-free endless fun &#8212; I know I would. üôÇ</p>

<p><em>Hugh Howey *did* eat the lunch of some other authors; he did displace them, if not on shelves, at least on the market. He has not invented a whole new market (&#8230;)</em></p>
<p>But he did just that. The big publishers refuse to sell their ebooks for less than $10. Howey sold his ebooks for much less than that ($3 if I recall). Though I can afford $10 ebooks, I do not buy them. Many people are like me.</p>
<p>Sure, my time is limited&#8230; but my time spent reading fiction is quite elastic&#8230; it depends very much on the availability of great content. Otherwise I do other things&#8230;</p>
<p>I would not have been reading other books had I not purchased Howey&rsquo;s ebooks.</p>
<p>But more generally, I think that many markets are highly elastic. When Harry Potter came out, it did not hurt other authors&#8230; it probably helped them because it brought a new generation of readers.</p>
<p>Science works this way. Einstein did not displace other physicists generally speaking. Sure, he did occupy one position at Princeton&#8230; but, on the whole, he probably helped create dozens of new jobs in physics.</p>
<p><em>The idea that the game of √¢‚Ç¨≈ìgreat value generation√¢‚Ç¨¬ù is open and welcoming is naive and disingenuous.</em></p>
<p>It is very hard to provide great value to others. But I am not sure that the other paths are easier for most.</p>

<p>I genuinely believe that life is more fun when you try to provide value to others instead of focusing on glamour humping.</p>
<p>I agree that being a tenured college professor is a privilege. You can dismiss my message because of that&#8230; but I do not think it is fair.</p>

<p>Thank you, Daniel, for your long reply. It refutes the best parts of my comments convincingly and it underscores a bit of my own hypocrisy.</p>
<p>You are optimistic about market elasticity, but you are right. Opportunities do come to light, and often enough too. Also, now I better see your point that if somebody is going to compete somewhere, it best be in a useful contest in the first place. Your comment puts your post in a light that makes it more encouraging and uplifting than I first saw.</p>
<p>Finally, I certainly don&rsquo;t dismiss your point out of your position of privilege. You&rsquo;re not trying to sell snake oil, you well know that hidden opportunities are, until found, hidden and risky. I walk away agreeing that competing in the game of value generation is certainly fun. It is obvious from my post that I have burned out myself (in a small way &#8212; I got better), but I have come back into the game. While I play it more carefully, I&rsquo;m having fun again. So acting all risk-averse and raining on your parade was disingenuous of me.</p>

<p>Your arguments were quite reasonable. My blog post could easily be misinterpreted because it was not as well written as it could have. (I should make it clear that I was not offended by your comment in the least.)</p>
<p>I think you have now nailed the message I wanted to share&#8230; On the long term, it is a lot more fun to focus on growing the size of the pie for everyone than to try a compete for scarce ressources&#8230;</p>

<p>Thanks for this post. I&rsquo;m a PhD student and I just had a paper rejected for the second time. This is a paper I really believed in. The rejection really hurt my motivation and my self-esteem as a computer scientist. It&rsquo;s good to be reminded that conference rejections don&rsquo;t necessarily mean that my work is worthless.</p>

<p>@Maxime</p>
<p>Getting your paper accepted in a selective venue is not the definition of success. Not the one I use. Not the one you should use.</p>
<p>I recommend setting your eyes on the real prize: doing useful research. </p>

<p>I know over a hundred people who make a living playing Starcraft or commenting Starcraft games. (I am sure their number is rather in the thousands.) The DOTA2 International, playing today (July 21, 2014) has a prize pool of almost 11 million dollars &#8211; <a href="http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.dota2.com/international/overview/</a></p>
<p>None of these people displaced anybody &#8211; these are jobs that not only did not exist &#8211; they COULD NOT have existed 20 years ago.</p>
