<p>What if I&rsquo;m not very sure how long it will take and how hard it will be for me to implement it? Charging a flat fee might make me work more and harder and receive way less, because I underestimate the complexity. Or because some requisites changed, and modifications were needed. Specially for someone without a lot of experience (like me) it&rsquo;s way more likely to spend five days solving a 5 minutes problem than the other way around, just because it might be something I&rsquo;ve never done before.</p>

<p>Of course, nobody knows how long things take&#8230; neither the client nor you&#8230; but as a businessman, you need to shoulder some of the risk.</p>
<p>For speculative work, there are ways to share the uncertainty with the client. For example, you can agree to do an initial survey for a flat fee.</p>
<p>But, it is undeniable that working for flat fees has risks&#8230; Early in your career, that probably means working at low hourly rates because simple things take you a long time&#8230; However, as you get better, you get to charge a lot for something that only takes you a few hours.</p>
<p>The client pays the &ldquo;market price&rdquo; for the service. If you are better than average, you earn more per hour than average&#8230; if you are bad, you earn much less than average. Your compensation depends on how skilled you are. That is how you want things to be&#8230; so you have strong incentives to get better.</p>
<p>Sure, the client can change the project or extend it&#8230; each time the client does that, you can renegotiate if you feel that it adds to your work. In fact, as a freelancer, you want projects to evolve, grow, change&#8230; you get to charge more and more. If a client keeps pulling the rug from under you and refuses to compensate you, then it is probably a bad client and you should find other clients. It is sad, but there are many bad clients. Dealing with them is part of the game.</p>

<p>Instead of getting paid hourly, you could get paid daily as well (a &ldquo;day&rdquo; could be ~8 hours on average for a client and you are not working for another client on the same day). Flat fee somewhat works for small projects (&lt; 1 month). Then on average you can do well even if you misjudge some projects (but keep some buffer fund for those times).</p>
