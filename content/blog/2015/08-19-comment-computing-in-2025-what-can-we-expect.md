<p>Don&rsquo;t forget how fundamentally CPU design is expected to change. We&rsquo;re going to have memory embedded with each core, and the cores will likely talk to each other through a network stack.</p>

<p>@Stan</p>
<p>Congratulations on the job at Dalhousie.</p>
<p><em>So the cloud wil be the invisible infrastructure that&rsquo;ll support unlimited memory?</em></p>
<p>The cloud already provides essentially infinite storage. However, in 2015, programmers have to worry about preserving memory, especially on mobile device. I think that this is a temporary limitation.</p>
<p>Of course, nothing is ever really infinite&#8230; by &ldquo;infinite&rdquo;, I mean &ldquo;something you do not worry about&rdquo;. (E.g., you have access to an infinite amount of popcorn.)</p>
<p><em>How about cheap universal 3D imaging devices that&rsquo;ll replace 2D?</em></p>
<p>I&rsquo;d be more excited about direct retinal or brain projections.</p>
<p>The eye is not nearly a perfect interface, if we could bypass it, it would be far better. Think of all the people who need glasses to read? Why would you need glasses to interact with a computer? Why should bad optics be a problem for computer interaction?</p>
<p>But I sure hope that surgeons will have access to full 3D projections of your body prior to critical interventions by 2025&#8230; but maybe that&rsquo;s too hopeful&#8230; since doctors still have stethoscopes from the IXXth century today.</p>
<p>We are being promised full virtual reality in gaming for the 2020s&#8230; but it seems we are still a full generation of two away&#8230; I guess that in 2025, we might get the PlayStation 6&#8230; who knows what that might do?</p>
<p><em>Do you foresee progress in brain-computer interface?</em></p>
<p>Handicapped people can control a mouse using their brain today&#8230; the problem is that it is invasive and not quite as accurate as a real keyboard.</p>
<p>We already use brain-computer interface to try to help people with cognitive diseases. Results are not quite conclusive yet&#8230; </p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t know&#8230;</p>
<p><em> Something&rsquo;s gotta replace the kbd, the oldest component of all personal devices, so voice input?</em></p>
<p>I find myself increasingly tempted to use Siri or Google voice search. It is not yet good enough for regular use, but if we can bring down the error rate by a factor of 4&#8230; </p>
<p>Would you want to do everything with voice though? Probably not&#8230;</p>
<p>I agree with you that we have to replace the keyboard at some point&#8230; Brain-computer interface would be *the* thing, but I don&rsquo;t see it for 2025&#8230; </p>
<p>So maybe we will still be stuck with keyboards. I hope not.</p>

<p>Right. I agree that it sounds plausible.</p>

<p>In 2025, I personally intend to be programming in Clojure (assuming that everyone else is on JVM / Javascript VM)</p>
<p>I hope there&rsquo;ll be a fairly syntactically close native Clojure compiler so I can dispense with the C, too.</p>
<p>The most exciting thing I&rsquo;ve seen recently is the <a href="http://makezine.com/2015/04/01/esp8266-5-microcontroller-wi-fi-now-arduino-compatible/" rel="nofollow ugc">http://makezine.com/2015/04/01/esp8266-5-microcontroller-wi-fi-now-arduino-compatible/</a> </p>
<p>This is now around $3, has built-in wifi and can run a node.js-like server written in Lua that can talk http or mqtt. </p>
<p>At this rate, I expect to see at least 16 cores, 1 gig of RAM and built-in wifi / bluetooth for under a dollar by 2025. Such these things will automatically mesh into a supercomputing cluster whenever you bring them in range of each other and Elixir will be the language of choice for learning to program them.</p>

<p>If your prediction is correct then GPUs either will be replaced with CPUs or gain even better performance 🙂</p>

<p>We will probably not be having a separate CPU/GPU. We will be having IPU&rsquo;s instead. Integrated processing units. I just coined the term 🙂</p>

<p>I think that the distinction between GPU and CPU is already blurring with technologies like Knight Landing.</p>
