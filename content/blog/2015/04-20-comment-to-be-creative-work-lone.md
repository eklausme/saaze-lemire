<p>In some places people get a cubicle, sometimes not even that. The reasons may be in economics, but they may be underestimating the cost of employees that cannot work (properly/productively).</p>

<p>I think the current managerial practice has little to do with productivity and everything to do with managing risk.</p>

<p>@trylks: Exactly, due to the lack of regard for 2nd degree expenses. (Being less productivity.)</p>
<p>@Dominic: It&rsquo;s usually not about risk management, but about risk avoidance. (Not willing to invest in people/practices, since you can get away with it in other lines of work than knowledge work.)</p>

<p>You say avoidance I say management. For managers, &ldquo;containing&rdquo; risk is all that counts. No one wants to be the guy that manages a &ldquo;death march&rdquo;.</p>

<p>(1) I guess that for faculty, it may be wise to stay at home one or two half-days each week, if their office is &ldquo;too open&rdquo; to students, colleagues etc. </p>
<p>(2) In France, research grants have long been strongly related to establishment of cooperations, esp. with industry but also purely academic. For 15 years, I witnessed (and have been involved in , have managed etc.) so many of these &ldquo;collaborative&rdquo; projects where people just wanted to work separately and pretended to cooperate when it was necessary. Now the gvt has partly changed to &ldquo;funding promising individuals&rdquo;.</p>

<p>@Marc</p>
<p>Students should certainly seek privacy to work. In Canada, most professors have private offices&#8230; and it is certainly allowable to declare yourself busy (one could even put a sign on the door). Some people like to go work in a café&#8230; I did that for many years and still do on occasion. Working from home works very well too, as long as you have the right kind of home.</p>

<p>It is not just France. </p>
<p>The problem is that none of these programs are assessed independently. So it all comes down to politics.</p>
