<p>Large projects are less efficient. It is hard to avoid as they get a lot of free riders.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, certain projects can&rsquo;t be executed by small teams, or small companies.</p>

<p>@Leonid</p>
<p>I do not think that large teams are intrinsically less efficient. For example, McDonald&rsquo;s is a lot better at making burgers than a small restaurant might be. Walmart is crazily efficient compared to an family store.</p>
<p>If you think about it, large laboratories do enjoy tremendous benefits. They should be a lot more productive. What happens is that there are specific mechanisms that counteract this increase in productivity.</p>

<p>@Daniel,</p>
<p>this is right! It is possible to achieve economies of scale, when you deal with simple repetitive tasks.</p>
<p>Research isn&rsquo;t one of such tasks. Oftentimes, people are working on problems that never appeared before.</p>
<p>To build a building, you generally know what to do. There is a methodology, building code, etc&#8230; Intellectual activity is unpredictable and projects are always well over the budget.</p>
<p>So, in a large team, it is always possible to find excuses not to work. Worse, you may not even notice that you work slowly and inefficiently, because there is no baseline.</p>

<p>It honestly doesn&rsquo;t surprise me that smaller labs or teams are more efficient! The bigger, well-funded stuff probably tends to get bogged down in bureaucracy, and the amount of people handling things probably leads to a lot of confusion about who does what.</p>
