title: "Lectures are the lazy personÂ´s approach to education"
---



Roger Schank is a famous computer science professor. [His take on lectures](http://educationoutrage.blogspot.ca/2015/01/why-do-we-give-lectures-why-does-anyone.html) is just brilliant:

> We still have lectures for one main reason. They are the lazy person&rsquo;s approach to education. Both lectures and listeners agree that neither of them wants to do much work. Real work, and real doing, and real conversation, is all that matters for learning, but education is really not about learning.
