<p>This is so true.</p>
<p>At the high school level (and probably at university, too), the prevalence of lecturing is also fuelled by the false sense of progress linked to &ldquo;covering&rdquo; all of the necessary curriculum within the time allotted for the course. There is a lot of pressure on teachers and professors to &ldquo;cover&rdquo; everything, even at the expense of not exploring important concepts as deeply as they should be, or eliding over less common cases.</p>
<p>If education were actually about learning, we wouldn&rsquo;t care so much about &ldquo;covering&rdquo; the curriculum and instead work to instil the skills in students needed to let them plug any gaps left over after the course is finished on their own.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s probably better to have like 10&#8230;15 minutes of &lsquo;lecture&rsquo; then do excercise, discuss, etc&#8230; and repeat.<br/>
But this involves more work that preparing standard 90 minute-long lecture (without any interaction with students)</p>

<p>Lectures have an interactive part and a non-interactive part. Interactive: when questions are asked (both directions). Non-interactive: when professors lecture.</p>
<p>IMHO, the standard approach should be: lectures on multimedia material, like coursera and similar approaches. Then some exercises, to check the lessons have been learned, and time to ask (collectively, like in a classroom, or a forum) the questions from the exercises *and* (most important and rarely done) the answers once the exercises have been done.</p>
<p>In CS this translates to code review, also (specially) of code that works. To make it more maintainable, readable, robust, efficient, etc.</p>
<p>This is very rare, yet (IMHO!) very useful and necessary.</p>
