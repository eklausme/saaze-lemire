<p>Good post, though I&rsquo;d quibble with the example.</p>
<p>There was some future-war fiction that included aircraft, even pre-1900. Google Albert Robida, &ldquo;War in the 20th Century&rdquo; from 1887. Astonishing stuff. Shortly after the Wrights but still prior to WWI, he did even better with La Guerre Infernale.</p>
<p>Octave Chanute was in touch with most serious experimenters including the Wrights, and publicly documenting the various efforts (see: Progress in Flying Machines). I&rsquo;m not a hardcore historian, but I do know a bit about the history of fiction, and the publicity surrounding various efforts at powered flight was enough to start changing fictional flying machines from flying boats and flying cigar-shaped airships to flying machines with wings &#8212; just a little bit &#8212; in the 1890s.</p>
<p>They didn&rsquo;t get it exactly right&#8230; the point of your post, I know&#8230; but I don&rsquo;t think it can be said we went from zero to warplanes between the Wrights and WWI. The quest for better flying machines had captured the public&rsquo;s imagination to the extent that there was a body of popular fiction devoted in part to it. Frank Reade was using his flying machines in all sorts of combat situations throughout the 1890s, for example.</p>
<p>It doesn&rsquo;t invalidate your point of course, but your post reminds me of something I think of often (again, from the fictional perspective)&#8230; the world thought that airships might look like flying boats for the most part, and then, around the 1890s, a magic moment where everyone started to lock in on the shape of the future.</p>
<p>Knowing the magic moment when you&rsquo;re living through it is the real trick, I suppose.</p>

<p>I see your point and think that you have good reasons to think that way.</p>
<p>It seems that there is a certain amount of difficulty for scientists to see much forward in their times. It was like this with Lord Kelvin, it is like this with us.</p>
<p>But in the other side, we have the history on our side, that have teached us a lot in the past century. I think that we&rsquo;re less skeptical today that we have been yesterday, because history taught us to become more carefull about skepticism.</p>
<p>We have learned to accumulate data, and we&rsquo;re trying hard to develop models to use that data in order to (try to) understand the future.</p>
<p>Or maybe the problem is just this: too many models and less imagination, dreams&#8230;</p>
