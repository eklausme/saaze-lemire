title: "The hopeless ones become college professors"
---



Many people [justify](http://blog.skanev.org/2013/03/why-not-do-phd-in-computer-science.html) their choice of pursuing graduate school by a desire to explore new ideas and satisfy their <em>intellectual curiosity</em>, an euphemism for <em>goofing off</em>.

These students use graduate school as a cultural hack&hellip; they turn what might be perceived as an asocial behaviour (e.g., spending 4 years writing a Perl compiler in JavaScript using Bayesian inference) into something that is tolerated and even encouraged. 

I think we need outlets where such smart people can go and do their things for a time. Indeed, most corporations do not want to collect employees who write Perl compilers in JavaScript using Bayesian inference. 

College can be a good place to park smart people until they find something productive to do. And the hopeless ones become college professors.
