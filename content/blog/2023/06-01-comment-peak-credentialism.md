<p>I think this is highly dependent on viewing this from a tech industry perspective.</p>

<p>I think it&rsquo;s viewed from any industry where you can measure viability of a candidate through other means. Any job where you can tangibly demonstrate your ability to get the job done or that you have specific desirable skillsets, coupled with other desirable characteristics like enthusias, passion, willingness to learn, is what will get you the job.</p>
<p>Some generic examples across any industry would be sales numbers, reducing customer complaints, manufacturing numbers vs industry average, reducing staff churn, a higher percentage of jobs completed to a high standard with happy customer testimonials compared to the industry average, etc.</p>

<p>Even though this is tech-specific, I think every industry should reconsider whether a modern college degree (which could mean almost anything) is really a requirement for employment. At worst, a college degree represents 4 more years of high school at a crippling cost to the student. At best, it&rsquo;s a real education with value add to the employer. I&rsquo;m afraid most degrees fall into the former category.</p>

<p>I don&rsquo;t agree with this assessment. A college degree is a space where skills can be developed and flexed without the career-defining consequences of total failure. Most college degrees make graduates better at thinking because those graduates grow their skills with other growing graduates. Most importantly that growth happens more collaboratively than competitively. Much like an academy for football or a school for cooking, it is the people that you train with that make you grow faster. College is where you are most likely to find the best people to train with.</p>
<p>I do think some segments of people benefit from not getting feedback and not training with others in a structured environment. But I claim that most do need feedback and training in a structured environment. By most I mean like 99.99%.</p>
<p>Now as to whether the price of college is extortionary &#8230; well you&rsquo;ve got a friend in me.</p>

<p><em>Most college degrees make graduates better at thinking because those graduates grow their skills with other growing graduates.</em></p>
<p>If that is true, then you don&rsquo;t need the college degree, you just need college attendance. Few people attend prestigious universities and just decide to never go get the degree. If you offer a choice to students&#8230; you get the classes and exams, but not the degree&#8230; or you get the degree, but you don&rsquo;t get any of the courses&#8230; which one do you think that students will pick? It is the degree they are after, not primarily the training.</p>
<p>In practice, it is very difficult to make someone a better thinker. There is not much evidence that college do that out of colleges.</p>
<p><em> Most importantly that growth happens more collaboratively than competitively. Much like an academy for football or a school for cooking, it is the people that you train with that make you grow faster. College is where you are most likely to find the best people to train with.</em></p>
<p>That&rsquo;s true: college can help expand your network. However, there are many other ways to do that especially if you are from a well-off family.</p>
<p><em>I do think some segments of people benefit from not getting feedback and not training with others in a structured environment. But I claim that most do need feedback and training in a structured environment. By most I mean like 99.99%.</em></p>
<p>Most jobs offer a structured environment where you can get feedback and training.</p>

<p>Here in Germany people still adhere strongly to so called &ldquo;ScheinglÃ¤ubigkeit&rdquo; (its an intended pun, can be translated as &ldquo;faith in degrees&rdquo;, but also as &ldquo;shiny delusion&rdquo;) &#8211; it is still almost impossible to get into higher positions without having graduated university.</p>
<p>That being said, it somewhat changed recently for high demand job segments, esp. in mid-level like programming jobs &#8211; companies started to be less picky about degrees and to look more for real (measurable) expertise, as there are simply not enough graduates to recruit. Still, not having a certain degree will most likely cut into the salary you can negotiate, as you are seen as &ldquo;suspicious&rdquo; for lacking the proper background or fundamentals.</p>
<p>On the other hand the educational standards at German universities are fairly equal throughout the country, at least for fundamentals and more general &ldquo;scientific thinking&rdquo;. Thus the name of the university will not have a big impact on your CV (unless for niche qualifications by a certain working group). Other things like international experience, will often be valued much higher.</p>
