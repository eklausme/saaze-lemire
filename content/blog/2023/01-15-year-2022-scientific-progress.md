The year 2022 is over. As with every year that passes, we have made some scientific progress. I found the following achievements interesting:

- [Diluting the blood plasma of older human beings rejuvenate them](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11357-022-00645-w).
- [In a nuclear fusion reactor, we have technically produced more energy than we put in.](https://theconversation.com/why-fusion-ignition-is-being-hailed-as-a-major-breakthrough-in-fusion-a-nuclear-physicist-explains-196475)
- Â [You can rejuvenate old human skins by grafting it on young mice](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/35749494/).
- ChatGPT is widely regarded as an AI breakthrough: [it can produce full length English essays that could pass as high school work](https://www.forbes.com/sites/steveforbes/2022/12/13/is-the-high-school-english-teacher-on-the-way-to-extinction/).
