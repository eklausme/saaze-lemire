<p>Your summary of link 3 is wrong. It was <em>Virgin Galactic&rsquo;s</em> first flight to carry private customers in space, not the first company to carry private customers in space. The Inspiration4 mission in 2021, operated by SpaceX, had an all-civilian, all-private crew, and spent a bit under three days in orbit. Roscosmos, the Russian state-owned corporation, has also carried private customers to space since 2004.</p>
