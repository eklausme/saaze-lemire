1. Ovaries age quickly in women. By the age of 40, most ovaries are poorly functional. However, [there is an ongoing clinical trial to check whether the drug rapamycin might slow down this aging](https://www.insider.com/rapamycin-antiaging-drug-for-ovaries-infertility-2023-4). It is one out of several initiatives to post-pospone and maybe reverse procreative aging in women.
1. [Glycine, a cheap supplement, might prolong life](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1568163723000818) by activating autophagy (the process by which your body eats up old cells) and by mimicking methionine restriction (effectively mimicking caloric restriction)
1. [Pregnant women who take antidepressants might be more at risk of having a child with autism](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamapediatrics/fullarticle/2476187). [About one in ten women takes antidepressants](https://www.wsj.com/articles/why-so-many-middle-aged-women-are-on-antidepressants-11648906393) in the USA.
1. <em>Scenarios set out under the UN Climate Panel (IPCC) show human welfare will likely increase to 450% of today&rsquo;s welfare over the 21st century</em>. [Climate damages will reduce this welfare an increase of merely 434%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0040162520304157).
1. [Overall environmental knowledge and climate-specific knowledge are negatively related to climate change anxiety](https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-023-03518-z). In other words, people who suffer from climate-change anxiety are likely poorly informed.
1. A lithium-air battery could have an energy density comparable to that of gasoline, and thus allow an electric car to go a long distance without recharging. [There are promising laboratory results](https://www.science.org/doi/10.1126/science.abq1347).
1. [Autonomous robots are burning unwanted weeds](https://interestingengineering.com/innovation/new-farming-robot-uses-ai-to-kill-100000-weeds-per-hour) which might lead to higher farming productivity and lower usage of pesticides. These results are not new and the feasibility has been established. A few years ago, one of my graduate students worked on detecting weeds in a field of blueberries using deep learning.
