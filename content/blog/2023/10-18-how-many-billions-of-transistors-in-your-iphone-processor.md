title: "How many billions of transistors in your iPhone processor?"
---



In about 10 years, Apple has multiplied by 19 the number of transistors in its mobile processors. It corresponds roughly to a steady rate of improvement of 34% per year on the number of transistors, or a doubling every 2.5 years. In real dollars, an iPhone has roughly a constant price: [the price tag of a new iPhone increases every year, but it does so while tracking the inflation](https://www.androidauthority.com/iphone-price-history-3221497/). Thus you are getting ever more transistors in your iPhone for the same price.
