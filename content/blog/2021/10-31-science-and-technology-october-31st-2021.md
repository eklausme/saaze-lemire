1. Though exoskeletons are exciting and they allow some of us to carry one with physical activities despite handicaps, [they appear to require quite a bit of brain power](https://neo.life/2021/10/is-your-exoskeleton-ready-for-primetime/). In effect, though they may help you move, they require a lot of mental effort which can be distracting. 
1. It is difficult to make people smarter by changing their environment. Socioeconomic background effects on children&rsquo;s cognitive development and student achievement are likely to be spurious according to [new research](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0160289621000660).
1. There is a U-shaped association between cardiovascular health and physical activity. [A moderate amount of physical activity is really good for you, but you can do too much](https://www.excli.de/index.php/excli/article/view/3818).
1. [In richer countries where women are treated as equals to men, there are greater differences between boys&rsquo; and girls&rsquo; aspirations](https://psyarxiv.com/zhvre/). For example, boys are more likely to be attracted to science compared to girls in a rich country.
1. Scientists spend ever more time in school for relatively few desirable positions. [These scientists are then ever more likely to pursue post-doctoral positions](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f159298.pdf). These longer studies are a significant net loss of their lifetime income.
