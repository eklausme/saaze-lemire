1. Apple announced new processors for its computers. Here is a table with the transistor count of some recent Apple processors:<br/>

processor                |release year             |transistors              |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
Apple A7                 |2013                     |1 billions               |
Apple A8                 |2014                     |2 billions               |
Apple A9                 |2015                     |2 billions               |
Apple A10                |2016                     |3.2 billions             |
Apple A11                |2017                     |4.3 billions             |
Apple A12                |2018                     |6.9 billions             |
Apple A13                |2019                     |8.5 billions             |
Apple A14                |2020                     |11.8 billions            |
Apple M1                 |2020                     |16 billions              |
Apple M1 Max             |2021                     |57 billions              |


We find that the number of transistors on commodity processors doubles every two years, approximatively. Furthermore, the energy usage of chips is trending downward: the Apple M1 Max reportedly uses less than 100 Watts, which is [comparable with processors of the last two decades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_CPU_power_dissipation_figures#Pentium_4) despite a much greater performance.<br/>
The storage capacity and bandwidth is also trending upward: the Apple M1 Max has 64GB of RAM with a bandwidth of 400GB/s.

However, our processors are increasingly parallel in nature: [the M1 Max has ten generic processing cores and 32 graphical cores](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2021/10/introducing-m1-pro-and-m1-max-the-most-powerful-chips-apple-has-ever-built/). You are unlikely to be able to make use of the 64 GB of RAM and of all of its bandwidth with a single core.
1. [It seems that older people might be more social, more likely to give to charity](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00118-3). [It seems to confirm earlier work](https://psycnet.apa.org/doiLanding?doi=10.1037%2F0882-7974.4.3.346).
1. A popular supplement (nicotinamide riboside) seems [to partially rejuvenate the immune system of old mice](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41514-021-00078-3). (I do not take nicotinamide riboside.)
1. Winter is coming. Maybe you are planning to hide from the cold? [It appears that cold exposure reduces neuroinflammation](https://www.cell.com/cell-metabolism/fulltext/S1550-4131(21)00480-0). Since too much inflammation is commonly a problem when you are not otherwise sick, these results suggest that going outside in the cold might do some good.
1. [Weaker students in the US have poorer and poorer scores in reading and mathematics](https://www.the74million.org/article/naep-long-term-unprecedented-performance-drop-american-13-year-olds/). The best students are still doing well. The net result is that the gap between the weak students and the best students is getting larger. (These results are unrelated to the recent pandemic.)
