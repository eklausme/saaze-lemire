1. [Radiation-therapy can rejuvenate heart cells](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-25730-0). (source: Nature)
1. Within members of the same species, cancer risk increases with body size. Large human beings are more at risk than smaller ones. Across species, the reverse is often true: cancer risks decrease with body size. Elephants are much less at risk of cancer than mice.<br/>
We do not know why it works this way: it is called [Peto&rsquo;s paradox](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Peto's_paradox). (Credit: [John D Cook](https://www.johndcook.com/blog/expert-hipaa-deidentification/))
1. [Large minimum wage increases reduced employment rates among low-skilled individuals by just over 2.5 percentage points](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29264).
1. [Researchers claim to have found a way to rejuvenate an important part of the immune system](https://ashpublications.org/blood/article-abstract/doi/10.1182/blood.2021012428/476454/Peripheral-B-cells-repress-B-cell-regeneration-in?redirectedFrom=fulltext) using hormonal signals. It is not yet in vivo (nobody was rejuvenated with this technique).
1. [Apple makes it easy to carry your electronic vaccination information with you](https://www.macrumors.com/2021/09/21/ios-15-vaccine-card-wallet-app/).
1. We have a processor for artificial intelligence containing [2.6 trillion transistors](https://singularityhub.com/2021/04/25/the-worlds-biggest-ai-chip-now-comes-stock-with-2-6-trillion-transistors/). It is many more transistors than we have neurons in the human brain.
1. Though most native Americans can be traced back to Asians who came to America 15,000 years ago, [we have increasing evidence of human life in America far older, going back 23,000 years ago](https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-58638854). What happened to these human beings and how they came to America is a mystery.
