<p>David Deutsch disagrees with this. He says that there exist ultimate &ldquo;truths&rdquo; (=models) not just in science, but also in art and history.</p>
<p>I really want to read &ldquo;<a href="https://arxiv.org/abs/1405.5563" rel="nofollow ugc">Constructor theory of information</a>&rdquo; where he should say something about it, but haven&rsquo;t yet.</p>
<p>That said, personally, I disagree with Deutsch, and agree with the statement that &ldquo;all models are wrong&rdquo;.</p>

<p>I should clarify that it should not follow from my post that I believe that there is no objective truth.</p>
<p>What I believe is that the humain brain is incapable of capturing or encoding this truth in its entirety. We are doomed in that sense.</p>

<p>No, there is no objective truth because there is no &ldquo;objective reality&rdquo; (no <strong>ding an sich</strong>) there are only models of reality from various observers, none of which is &ldquo;true&rdquo; of course.</p>
<p>What passes for objective reality is a rough intersubjective consensus of many observers about their models.</p>
