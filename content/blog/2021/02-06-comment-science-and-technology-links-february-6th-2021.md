<p>The Antarctic is not warming &#8211; this fits nicely with a recent paper <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-020-03094-7" rel="nofollow ugc">Antarctic icebergs reorganize ocean circulation during Pleistocene glacials</a>. The mechanism underlying the termination of both glacials and interglacials is not yet understood but I suspect that climate models with any predictive power will be tightly coupled with models of the hydrosphere and cryosphere (glacial water) and not just the CO2 of the atmosphere.</p>

<p>The activity of kids with autism piece is glaringly obvious in hindsight. The predominant physical activity of young boys is team games. Boys with autism spectrum disorder often find themselves marginalised socially, so the opportunity to play these games is diminished accordingly.</p>
