1. [Growing your own food could lower your carbon footprint by 3-5%](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0959652618305936).
1. In recent years, we have acquired the ability to measure biological age: your chronological age does not necessarily match your biological since some people age faster. We measure biological aging with gene expression. [Researchers found that an eight-week program of diet, exercise, and meditation could reduce biological age by two years](https://doi.org/10.18632/aging.202913). The study was small and short.
1. You may have heard that younger and older people are happier, with middle-aged people reporting less happiness. [Kratz suggests that such studies might not have been methodologically sound](https://psyarxiv.com/d8f2z/).
1. Our brain is not good at producing new neurons. However, we have a rather abundant supply of another brain cell, astrocytes. [Researchers took astrocytes and converted them into fully functional, integrated neurons](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41421-021-00243-8) (in mice). (Source: Nature)
1. [A beer might produce between 200,000 and 2 million bubbles before going flat](https://www.acs.org/content/acs/en/pressroom/presspacs/2021/acs-presspac-april-21-2021/cracking-open-the-mystery-of-how-many-bubbles-are-in-a-glass-of-beer.html).
1. We now have the technology to edit your genes, or the genes your babies. CRISPR-Cas9 allows us to edit individual genes in a cell. But editing genes might often be unnecessary for medical purposes: it might suffice to silence or express the gene. [Researchers have come up with a new technique called CRISPRoff](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33838111/) which might do just that.
1. [The USA is approving the use of drones over people and at night](https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/new-rules-allowing-small-drones-fly-over-people-us-take-effect-2021-04-21/).
1. [Omega 3 supplements may lower inflammation and boost repair mechanisms](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01077-2). (Source: Nature)
1. [You may finally have an effective vaccine against Malaria](https://blogs.sciencemag.org/pipeline/archives/2021/04/23/great-malaria-vaccine-news).
1. [It appears that bimekizumab might be a remarkably effective drug against psoriasis or other related diseases](https://dx.doi.org/10.1056/NEJMoa2102388).
1. [New anti-depressants appear to increase suicide risks among teenagers](https://www.karger.com/Article/Fulltext/501215).
1. When seeking venture capital, [female and Asians entrepreneurs may have slightly more luck with investors](https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3301982).
1. As your cells divide, it is believed that small mutations are introduced. [Recent research suggests that even cells that never divide may mutate](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-021-03477-4).
1. Adult mammals heal from injuries by forming scars. [A new drug may prevent scars](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/372/6540/eaba2374). It works in mice.
1. Worms live longer when they have less food. [It appears that smelling food is enough to make this effect go away](https://www.nature.com/articles/s43587-021-00039-1). (Source: Nature) 
1. [Reducing your blood pressure is always a good thing](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/lancet/article/PIIS0140-6736(21)00590-0/fulltext).
