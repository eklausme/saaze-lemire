1. [Government-funded research is getting more political and less diverse](https://cspicenter.org/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/CSPI.No4_.pdf):<br/>

> The frequency of documents containing highly politicized terms has been increasing consistently over the last three decades. The most politicized field is Education &amp; Human Resources. The least are Mathematical &amp; Physical Sciences and Computer &amp; Information Science &amp; Engineering, although even they are significantly more politicized than any field was in 1990. At the same time, abstracts have been becoming more similar to each other over time. Taken together, the results imply that there has been a politicization of scientific funding in the US in recent years and a decrease in the diversity of ideas supported.
