<p>I am not a touch typist, so keyboard problems seem to be the big hold up in the use of VR.</p>
<p>What seems to me to be necessary is a way of detecting where the fingertips are so that they can be shown with either a real keyboard or a virtual keyboard. This seems to apply some sort of gloves or even a Band-Aid type stick on which goes over the fingertips. Using some sort of capacitive device like the cards which let you into doors that I&rsquo;ve used in the past might be usable since otherwise power might be a problem.</p>
<p>Once the fingertip location problem has been solved, then we have to decide between a physical and virtual keyboard. Virtual would be easier to initially implement since we could just have a virtual keyboard with a location locked in space so that when the fingertips move they move relative to the keyboard. I don&rsquo;t know whether an actual keyboard would be easier to implement.</p>
