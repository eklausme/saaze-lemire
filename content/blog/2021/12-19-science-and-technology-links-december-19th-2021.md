1. [Becoming a physician increases the use of antidepressants, opioids, anxiolytics, and sedatives, especially for female physicians](https://www.nber.org/papers/w29536).
1. When trying to reproduce results in cancer researchers, [independent researchers find that the benefits are typically grossly exaggerated](https://elifesciences.org/articles/71601).
1. [A large planet has been found orbiting two suns](https://www.theepochtimes.com/mkt_app/astronomers-discover-massive-planet-10-times-bigger-than-jupiter_4147366.html). It is orbiting from very far away.
1. [NASA sent a probe in the atmosphere of the sun](https://www.nasa.gov/feature/goddard/2021/nasa-enters-the-solar-atmosphere-for-the-first-time-bringing-new-discoveries).
1. As you age, you accumulate old (senescent) cells. These cells are dysfunctional and in sufficient quantity might cause harm to your body such as chronic inflammation. Researchers found a plant-derived compound (procyanidin C1 or PCC1) which [can not only limit the harm due to senescent cells but also eliminate some of them](https://www.nature.com/articles/s42255-021-00491-8). It is so beneficial that treated mice live longer.
