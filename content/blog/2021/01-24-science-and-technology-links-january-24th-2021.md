1. Year 2020 was great for PC makers. [We are selling more and more PCs](https://www.gartner.com/en/newsroom/press-releases/2021-01-11-gartner-says-worldwide-pc-shipments-grew-10-point-7-percent-in-the-fourth-quarter-of-2020-and-4-point-8-percent-for-the-year). Reportedly, [Sony sold 3.4 million PlayStation 5 in only four weeks](https://www.gizmochina.com/2020/12/31/sony-ps5-sales-2020-targets-in-2021-report/), a record. [The demand for the Facebook Quest 2 VR headset is reportedly several times the demand for the original Quest](https://www.vrfocus.com/2020/10/oculus-quest-2-sales-surpass-facebook-expectations-pre-orders-5x-more-than-original-quest/). [Valve, the company that makes the Index VR headset, is unable to make enough to meet demand](https://uploadvr.com/gabe-newell-index-supply-shortage/). The demand for computer chips is so high that [car manufacturers ran out of chips and had to close car factories](https://www.scmp.com/business/companies/article/3118467/how-did-worlds-carmakers-run-out-chips-it-was-year-bad-planning). [The demand for workers in information technology has remained strong throughout 2020](https://www.calcalistech.com/ctech/articles/0,7340,L-3848497,00.html).

1. As we age, we accumulate senescent cells. In chronic large quantities, these cells are harmful. Thankfully, there are now effective therapies to remove these cells, at least in mice. Doing so makes [the old mice smarter](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/acel.13296). This suggests that the senescent cells makes them dumber in the first place.
1. [Supplementing old mice with a hormone that our bodies generate during execise makes them run twice as hard](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/33473109/).
1. [Researchers rejuvenated old human cells by 30 years](https://doi.org/10.1101/2021.01.15.426786). The process is tricky and most be done in a laboratory but it is conceivable that human tissue could be rejuvenated in a laboratory, prior to transplantation.
1. [Cold water immersion following an endurance workout probably reduces your muscle growth](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/31222379/). So go easy with the cold showers and baths!
