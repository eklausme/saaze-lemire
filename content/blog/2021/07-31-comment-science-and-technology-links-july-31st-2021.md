<p>The original paper title for the 319 TB/s paper is &ldquo;319 Tb/s Transmission Over 3001 km With S, C and L Band Signals Over &gt;120nm Bandwidth in 125 Î¼m Wide 4-Core Fiber&rdquo;. So, it&rsquo;s &ldquo;terabits/s&rdquo;, it&rsquo;s not over the Internet, it&rsquo;s not even using IP. It&rsquo;s still an achievement, but for layer 1 transmissions. The article you mention now says &ldquo;terabits&rdquo;, but this may have been corrected in the meantime.</p>

<p>Nuclear energy is awesome.</p>
<p>You already have it in the form of CANDU, and I hope your governments, both provincial and federal, wise up to this and start building CANDU plants in quantity. Nearby Ontario is already &ldquo;the France of North America&rdquo; in the sense of producing the lowest-carbon-emitting energy in the hemisphere, mostly via nuclear.</p>
<p>The problem with the fusion energy space is that you can pick a year going back at least 50 and find similarly extravagant claims that it&rsquo;s just around the corner. At some point, absence of evidence really does turn into evidence of absence.</p>
