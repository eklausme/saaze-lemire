1. [Most people were able to cure their diabetes by losing weight](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1111/dme.14395) in a clinical trial.
1. [Video games improve intelligence over many years, while socializing has no effect](https://psyarxiv.com/jtwk7/).
1. To go to Mars safely, [time is of the essence because astronauts would be exposed to radiations and particles from outside of solar system](https://newsroom.ucla.edu/releases/safe-for-humans-fly-to-mars).
1. [It is unlikely that there is an upper bound to human longevity under 130 years](https://royalsocietypublishing.org/doi/10.1098/rsos.202097). Though men have a drastically reduced longevity compared to women, it appears that once you reach 108 years, there may not be any gender difference.
1. [Recent progress having to do with protein folding can be largely attributed to better hardware and more data, and not really to a better understanding of protein folding](https://www.science.org/content/blog-post/another-way-do-protein-structure-prediction). The same could be said for natural language processing. (Speculative)
1. [The children of the survivors of Chernobyl do not have excess mutations](https://www.science.org/content/article/no-excess-mutations-children-chernobyl-survivors-new-study-finds). It is consistent with a worldview that radiations are less harmful to our biology than commonly assumed.
1. [Researchers have built flexible glass that is much stronger](https://interestingengineering.com/researchers-have-developed-a-new-kind-of-unbreakable-glass)Â and flexible. It does not shatter easily.
