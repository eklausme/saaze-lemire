1. The Earth is spinning faster and faster: <a href="https://www.livescience.com/earth-spinning-faster-negative-leap-second.html"><em>The 28 fastest days on record (since 1960) all occurred in 2020, with Earth completing its revolutions around its axis milliseconds quicker than average</em></a>.
1. [We are soon getting a new Wi-Fi standard called Wi-Fi 6: it supports data transmission at over 1 GB/s, nearly three times the speed of previous standards](https://www.theverge.com/2019/2/21/18232026/wi-fi-6-speed-explained-router-wifi-how-does-work).
1. [Eli Dourado predicts](https://elidourado.com/blog/notes-on-technology-2020s):<br/>

> By the middle of the decade, augmented reality will be widely deployed, in the same way that smart watches are today. Glasses will be computing devices. Every big tech company has a glasses project at a relatively mature stage in the lab today. The need for the glasses to understand context could result in much smarter digital assistants than todayâ€™s Siri, Alexa, and so on.


I agree with Dourado.
1. [Vitamin D3 may reduce the risk of developing advanced cancer](https://jamanetwork.com/journals/jamanetworkopen/fullarticle/2773074).
1. [High-tech running shoes improve elite marathon performance](https://www.medrxiv.org/content/10.1101/2020.12.26.20248861v1).
1. In our brains, neurons are connected toghether by their dendrites. It seems that, at least in human beings, [large dendrites are capable of computation on their own](https://science.sciencemag.org/content/367/6473/83).
1. [A study of 145 journals in various fields, spanning 1.7 million authors, revealed that there was no obvious bias against authors with female names](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/2/eabd0299) and, in fact, female authors might even be slightly favored by referees. Such a study does not show that sexism does not exist. It does not show that journals have never been biased against female authors.
