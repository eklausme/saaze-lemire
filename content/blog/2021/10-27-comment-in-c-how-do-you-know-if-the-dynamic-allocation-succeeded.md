<p>And shared libraries might be counted in both real and virtual memory for every process that uses them even though they&rsquo;re taking up the same pages of read-only or copy-on-write memory, and memory mapped files might be counted in their entirety in virtual memory even if only a small section of the file ever gets read, and on Linux the Out-Of-Memory killer might choose to kill a *different* process when your process tries to get real access to overallocated virtual memory, and the C shared library might not *really* release the memory you free() because it&rsquo;s faster to keep it around to avoid hitting up the kernel when you next try to malloc(), and none of this stuff is set in stone in a standard so for all I know anything or everything I&rsquo;ve just recalled might be years out of date&#8230;</p>
<p>I hate this stuff. At least heap allocation all ends up going through a few bottleneck APIs, so you can get a vague handle on memory usage optimization with an LD_PRELOAD to intercept and tally those calls.</p>
<p>I was originally going to comment that it was disappointing when your blog post didn&rsquo;t really answer the question posed in your blog title, especially compared to your usual detailed answers to these sorts of questions. But I guess that&rsquo;s not at all your fault; the best answer we can get might really be: if nothing crashes later then the allocation must have succeeded in some sense? I assume this is why some embedded systems people end up trying to just keep everything on the stack or in static globals.</p>

<p>Thanks for the comment. I do not answer my own question because it is, as you remarked, non-trivial, at least if you rely on purely standard C.</p>

<p>In embedded:</p>
<p>&#8211; we rarely have a lot of memory and not all of it has the same properties<br/>
&#8211; standard C doesn&rsquo;t have a way to interrogate your heap (or stack) utilization&#8230;<br/>
&#8211; other platform specific stuff (heck, you might not even have an allocator)<br/>
&#8211; debugging can be quite challenging</p>
<p>all contributing to the &ldquo;odd&rdquo; ways we write C code.</p>

<p>Also in embedded we aren&rsquo;t sharing the memory with other processes so it&rsquo;s all ours from the get go.</p>

<p>This actually has more to do with how &ldquo;overcommit&rdquo; is set up on the system, than with the difference between virtual and physical memory. </p>
<p>You may try the same on a Linux system with overcommit turned off. This is done with /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory unless I remember wrong. Or, try on a Windows system &#8211; Windows does not allow overcommit (but still uses the same virtual/physical memory design).</p>
<p>The VM subsystem knows perfectly well that you&rsquo;re allocating more than it can deliver, despite the memory being virtual. Overcommit was originally allowed to ease porting of some older software to Linux. Today it may make sense if a process uses vast address space for IO &#8211; that is not backed up by actual memory pages &#8211; but in general, turning overcommit off is a good thing for development. Makes finding memory related issues a lot quicker.</p>

<p>This is operating system issue. Linux has 3 overcommit modes, heuristic (default), always, and never. </p>

<p>Interestingly, it says &ldquo;Obvious overcommits of address space are refused.&rdquo; Does it mean we can observe malloc failure in this mode?</p>

<p>I tried on my box: If /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory is zero, the process exits cleanly with ‚Äúerror!‚Äù; if it is one, the process is terminated by the OOM killer after some time (my Laptop does not have 1T üòâ</p>
<p>Normally, I have /proc/sys/vm/overcommit_memory set to zero. As the other Alex said, it is convenient for developing.</p>
