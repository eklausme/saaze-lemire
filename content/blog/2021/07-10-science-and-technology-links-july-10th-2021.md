1. We use CRISPR, a state-of-the-art gene editing technique, [to edit the genes of live human patients in a clinical trials](https://www.msn.com/en-in/money/markets/intellia-therapeutics-soars-58-after-its-gene-editing-crispr-therapy-shows-success-in-first-human-trials/ar-AALxyRH).
1. [A clinical trial has begun regarding an HIV vaccine](https://www.ox.ac.uk/news/2021-07-05-hiv-vaccine-trial-starts-oxford).
1. If you choose to forgo meat to fight climate change, [you may lower your individual&rsquo;s lifetime warming contribution by 2 to 4%](https://www.mdpi.com/2071-1050/13/10/5568/htm).
1. [Age-related testosterone loss may strongly contribute to brain dysfunction in older men](https://www.aging-us.com/article/203153/text).
1. [Israel has used autonomous drone swarms to hunt down its adversaries](https://www.the-sun.com/news/3222879/israel-first-ever-drone-swarm-hamas/).
1. [Cleaner air has improved agricultural outputs](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1748-9326/ac0fa4).
1. [Drinking alcohol could extend or reduce your life depending on how you go about it](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0025619621001567). Drinking to excess could be harmful but moderate alcohol consumption with meals could be beneficial.
1. [Injectable gene editing compounds have extended the lifespan of mice by more than 30% while improving physical performance](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/10.1101/2021.06.26.449305v1).
1. [A gene therapy may get your heart to regenerate after a heart attack](https://stm.sciencemag.org/content/13/600/eabd6892).
1. [Ocean acidification does not appear to harm coral reef fishes](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41586-019-1903-y):<br/>

> Together, our findings indicate that the reported effects of ocean acidification on the behaviour of coral reef fishes are not reproducible, suggesting that behavioural perturbations will not be a major consequence for coral reef fishes in high CO2 oceans. (Source: Nature)

1. It appears that [when an embryon is formed, it briefly undergoes a rejuvenation effect](https://advances.sciencemag.org/content/7/26/eabg6082.full). It would explain how old people can give birth to a young child.
1. We have long believed that Alzheimer&rsquo;s was caused by the accumulation of misfolded proteins in the brain. [It appears that it could be, instead, due to the disappearance of soluble proteins in the brain](https://www.thelancet.com/journals/eclinm/article/PIIS2589-5370(21)00268-6/fulltext). If so, the cure for Alzheimer&rsquo;s would entail restoring a normal level of proteins instead of removing misfolded proteins.
1. [A new weight-loss drug was approved to fight against obesity](https://apnews.com/article/science-obesity-lifestyle-business-health-c6f992d717c6461ef20f40e6d4ee9d25).
1. [Unity Biotechnology announced some positive results](https://ir.unitybiotechnology.com/news-releases/news-release-details/unity-biotechnology-announces-positive-data-phase-1-clinical) in a clinical trial using senolytics (drugs that kill old cells) to treat macular degeneration (a condition that make old people blind).
1. Lobsters are believed to experience [negligible senescence](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Negligible_senescence), meaning that they do not age the way we do. [They also appear to avoid cancer](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2021/06/how-do-most-lobsters-stay-cancer-free-newly-sequenced-genome-could-reveal-their-secrets?fbclid=IwAR1W5gemd7awlzraK_aY7PQxIYeqiDbpilwiXnKl0a0DdA9olRDg8dJAYxA).
