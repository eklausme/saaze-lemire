<blockquote><p>
It now seems possible that the technology used to produce a COVID-19 vaccine in weeks could produce cancer vaccines. Why did we need a pandemic to find that out?
</p></blockquote>
<p>You have it in the wrong order, as is also evident from the date on your link.</p>
<p>The reality is that BioNTech was in the business of researching cancer vaccines for years, and repurposed its platform for COVID-19, which appears to be a comparatively easy target for vaccines. Afaiu Moderna is a similar story.</p>
<p>As to why you personally did not find out before the pandemic: It&rsquo;s not your field of study, and people actively pursue many promising avenues for new drugs, many of which never pan out.</p>
<p>There is an entire cottage industry of typically abysmal popscience articles a la &ldquo;OMG! This scientist is developing this awesome Cure For Cancer (TM)&rdquo;.</p>
<p>What is your exact complaint here? Are you saying that &ldquo;Nature Reviews Drug Discovery&rdquo; is too low-key a journal for the linked article? Do you think that 2018 is too late as a publication date? Do you think the NY Times should have published a big article about that development in 2018?</p>

<p><em>You have it in the wrong order, as is also evident from the date on your link.</em></p>
<p>I am not assuming that the technology was developed for the pandemic. I am aware that it existed prior to the pandemic.</p>
<p><em>What is your exact complaint here? Are you saying that “Nature Reviews Drug Discovery” is too low-key a journal for the linked article? </em></p>
<p>The mRNA work is well published and there are highly cited papers going back many years.</p>
<p>The section of my blog post you are commenting is about transfer. Publishing in Nature is not transfer. Transfer is deploying the technology.</p>
<p>I am not complaining that they failed to publish research papers.</p>
<p><em>As to why you personally did not find out before the pandemic: It’s not your field of study, and people actively pursue many promising avenues for new drugs, many of which never pan out.</em></p>
<p>I am not a medical expert in any sense of the word, but I do tend to learn about successfully deployed technology.</p>
<p>I am pretty sure that even medical doctors were unaware that we had the ability to produce new vaccines in weeks from DNA data dumps.</p>
