<p>Compressibility is one concern, performance is another (write, lookup,&#8230;). Some operations can be 100 times slower with random identifiers. To solve this, there is a new types of UUIDs that are &ldquo;less&rdquo; random: <a href="https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28088213" rel="nofollow ugc">https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=28088213</a> &#8211; by using a more-or-less precise timestamp, plus some random bits. I think it would be interesting to analyze compressibility with those as well.</p>

<p>The reason to use uuid column types in a database is so you can skip locking dB sequences or using synchronization strategies like HiLo and just generate collision-free identifiers client-side. Additionally, some databases will use the randomness to give you free uniformly distributed sharding.</p>
<p>But those random identifiers have no intrinsic value. So long as your database is a complete view of the data you wish to compress (i.e. a closed graph with nothing from the outside world pointing in) then one distinct identifier is as good as another. You can consider a compression strategy that replaces uuid x with an (irreversible) one-to-one mapping value y as a form of lossy compression that gives you an equivalent but not identical dataset upon decompression.</p>
<p>Depending on where, how, and why the compression is taking place, that could be good enough. If there is an additional non-constrained channel available for the non-hot path, the mapping could also be exported separately to allow for reversing the mappings out-of-band.</p>
