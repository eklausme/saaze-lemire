1. Reportedly, [half of us own a smartphone](https://news.strategyanalytics.com/press-releases/press-release-details/2021/Strategy-Analytics-Half-the-World-Owns-a-Smartphone/default.aspx).
1. It is often reported that women or visible minority earn less money. However, [ugly people are doing comparatively even more poorly](https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/715141).
1. We have highly efficient and cheap solar panels. However, we must also quickly dispose of them after a few years which leads to trash. [Handling an increasing volume of trash is not cheap](https://hbr.org/2021/06/the-dark-side-of-solar-power):<br/>

> The totality of these unforeseen costs could crush industry competitiveness. (&hellip;) By 2035, discarded panels would outweigh new units sold by 2.56 times. In turn, this would catapult the [cost] to four times the current projection. The economics of solar — so bright-seeming from the vantage point of 2021 — would darken quickly as the industry sinks under the weight of its own trash.

1. [Ultrasounds may be a viable therapy against Alzheimer&rsquo;s](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41380-021-01129-7).
1. [Axolotls regenerate any part of their body, including their spinal cord](https://elifesciences.org/articles/55665). Though they only weight between 60g and 110g, [they may live 20 years](https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fcell.2021.689062/full#B85).
1. [Some dinosaurs once thrived in the Arctic](https://www.cell.com/current-biology/fulltext/S0960-9822(21)00739-9).
1. It was once believed that hair greying was essentially an irreversible process. Researchers looked at actual hair samples and found that in many cases, [a hair that once turned gray could regain its colour](https://elifesciences.org/articles/67437).
1. At least as far as your muscles go, you can remain fit up to an advanced age. As supportive evidence, researchers found that [human muscle stem cells are refractory to aging](https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/acel.13411):<br/>

> We find no measurable difference in regeneration across the range of ages investigated up to 78 years of age.


Further work shows that [you can promote muscle regeneration by reprogramming the cells in muscle fibers](https://www.nature.com/articles/s41467-021-23353-z), thus potentially activating these muscle stem cells.
1. Many people who are overweight suffer from the metabolic syndrome which includes abdominal obesity, high blood pressure, and high blood sugar. [It affects about 25% of us worldwide](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5866840/). Researchers have found that a particular hormone, [Asprosin](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Asprosin), is elevated in people suffering for the metabolic syndrome. [Suppressing asprosin in animal models reduced appetite and increased leanness, maybe curing the metabolic syndrome](https://elifesciences.org/articles/63784). We may hope that this work will quickly lead to human trials.
1. During the current decade, [the share of Canadians that are 65 years and older  will rise from 17.4 per cent to 22.5 per cent of the population](https://www.fraserinstitute.org/blogs/governments-across-canada-face-mounting-fiscal-challenges-due-to-aging-population).
1. [The Internet probably use less energy than you think and most projections are pessimistic](https://www.cell.com/joule/fulltext/S2542-4351(21)00211-7).
