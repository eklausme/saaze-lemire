title: "Hard problems and hot coffee"
---



I recently realized that I suffer from the __hard problem, hot coffee__ syndrome.

What is it? Well, when I have a hard problem to solve on my to do list, and if this problem has become a priority, I will start procrastinating. So far, that&rsquo;s not uncommon. But then, because I try to muster enough energy to tackle the problem, I will start drinking more and more coffee, up to 3 or 4 a day. At this point, I become really energetic, at least for a little while, but I find all sorts of convenient ways to avoid the problem I must solve. For example, I will start writting on my blog instead of working hard on my problem.

Now, if you&rsquo;ll excuse me, I&rsquo;ve got to get back to this damn problem&hellip; or go drink another coffee&hellip;
