title: "Research is a form of art"
---



I was chatting with [Yuhong](https://flydragony.blogspot.com/) and Martin; both are among the best researchers I know. One thing leading to another, we began to wonder whether we knew how to do research&hellip; and to answer this question, you need to ask what research is&hellip;

I think research is a form of art. Or maybe art is a form of research&hellip; The point is that there is no one-true-way to do research. Research cannot be measured, it cannot be packaged, it cannot be industrialized&hellip; Not anymore than art&hellip;.

Asking how do you become a good researcher is like asking how you can become<br/>
a good artist&hellip; there is no straight answer, except a few guidelines:

1. don&rsquo;t be isolated&hellip; be part of a network
1. be open minded
1. don&rsquo;t copy or try to be fashionable, always try to go further and<br/>
lead
