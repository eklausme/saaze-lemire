[Gmail](https://gmail.google.com) is a really smart email client. I found out it is even better than I thought. If you want to quickly find unread messages in your inbox, just search for &ldquo;label:inbox is:unread&rdquo;.

The trick also is to &ldquo;star&rdquo; the messages you want to come back to. This is much better than leaving them unread which is really a hack if you think about it. You build a todo list, always one click away.
