According to COMPUTERWOCHE ONLINE, IBM is killing its DB/2 Olap Server by breaking its deal with Hyperion. This somewhat surprising move brings questions as to what IBM will do in the Business Intelligence arena&hellip; partner with Oracle or Microsoft, or do do something else? Maybe get out of the OLAP business altogether?
