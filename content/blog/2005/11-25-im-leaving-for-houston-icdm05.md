---



From Nov. 26th to Dec. 1st 2005, I&rsquo;m be in Houston for [ICDM&rsquo;05](http://www.cacs.louisiana.edu/~icdm05/) where I&rsquo;ll present our paper [An Optimal Linear Time Algorithm for Quasi-Monotonic Segmentation](https://lemire.me/fr/abstracts/ICDM05.html). For a limited time, [my slides are available on the Web](https://lemire.me/talks/icdm05_slides.pdf).

(If you are a thief, I&rsquo;ve got two sons guarding my house, so don&rsquo;t bother.)
