title: "Google launches an online RSS aggregator"

Google did it, finally. They launched [a beta of their RSS aggregator](https://www.google.com/reader). It is still a bit immature, but I&rsquo;m trying it out. I&rsquo;m already a bit fan of [gmail](https://mail.google.com) which has become my sole email client.
