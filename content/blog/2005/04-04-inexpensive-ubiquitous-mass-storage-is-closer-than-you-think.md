title: "Inexpensive ubiquitous mass storage is closer than you think!"
---



I started using Google Mail (GMail) last year because I want to be able to read my mail from everywhere, all the time. Google offered me 1000 MB of free storage and one of the greatest user interface for a mail client. Oh! Did I mention it has nearly perfect spam filtering, without any effort on my part?

I wondered what would happen when I would reached 1000 MB of mail. For me, that&rsquo;s about 2 years of incoming mail, maybe a bit less.

Well, my account has now 2057 MB of storage. That&rsquo;s about 3 years worth of storage. It seems like Google increases your limit as need arises.
