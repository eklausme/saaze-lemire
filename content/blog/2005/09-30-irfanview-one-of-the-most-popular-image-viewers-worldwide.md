I installed [IrfanView](http://www.irfanview.com/) on my wife&rsquo;s computer today (Windows 98 &#8212; yep!). My wife is in charge of editing our pictures, and she complained about the tools she had&hellip; so I decided to try something new. IrfanView is freeware and, I must say, pretty impressive. Mostly, it is a __simple__ tool for __picture editing__. It doesn&rsquo;t try to be another Photoshop and it runs __fast__.

I&rsquo;ve spent good money about 2 years ago on a similar piece of software which shall remain nameless. It was so bad, I uninstalled in within minutes. I&rsquo;m not claiming software ought to be free, but I never want to buy another piece-of-software-on-a-CD.

I tried to convince my wife to use Gimp, but Gimp is just too contrived for most people. I&rsquo;ve got a Ph.D., and I would need two hours to correct red eyes using it.
