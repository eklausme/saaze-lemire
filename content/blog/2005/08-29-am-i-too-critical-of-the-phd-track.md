title: "Am I too critical of the Ph.D. track?"
---



I believe that what I&rsquo;m trying to achieve with some of my more critical posts about the Ph.D. track is to provide &ldquo;a candid acknowledgement of the sacrifices and conflicts that came with the field.&rdquo;
An older article in Salon has interesting quotes on this theme&hellip;

> Academia is a world that is not set up to nurture a marriage or a personal life in general.


or

> Male professors are expected to be married to their scholarship but not to their wives in the same full-on, participatory way. Women academics are asked to be polygamous and then are punished as a result.


__Update:__ Buddhamouse think I&rsquo;m too critical. Her comment can be summarized as follow: getting a Ph.D. can be fun work, and then, you can go search for work outside academia. (Oh! And &ldquo;just say no to postdocs&rdquo;.)
