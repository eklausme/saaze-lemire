<p>The lost cost of studying in Quebec is for Quebec-residents, based on the idea that our families have paid taxes for X number of years, and so we should get access to these provincially-funded institutions of higher learning (which I think is a good idea). If you are a Canadian from outside of quebec, the cost is x3, and if you are an international student, it is from x8 to x10. </p>
<p>Note also that while tuition for residents is frozen and has been for some time, rates for international students are not. </p>
<p>At least this is true of McGill, but I believe it is the same at other local universities.</p>
<p>I believe that the rising cost of higher ed are one of the factors that will lead to less people attending university.</p>

<p>I think that the <i>Times Argus</i> article overstates the situation. I&rsquo;m also skeptical of the statistics regarding percentage of college students with family income over $100,000. I certainly don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s the case at the large public universities. I note that it says about the author, &ldquo;Brian C. Greenberg is a Certified Public Accountant and Certified College Planning Specialist.&rdquo; Writing articles such as these is a standard marketing approach for consultants, and Mr. Greenberg can hardly be said to be a disinterested party.</p>
<p>Much of the increases in tuition at public schools has been the result of a reduction in funding from states, as the populace at large decides that education isn&rsquo;t important to them. However, a good portion of these increases are used to fund financial aid to those students who need it. That is the model that private schools use. In a way, this is akin to a progressive education tax, but only levied against those actually using the system. It&rsquo;s not the best approach, but it&rsquo;s hard to get people to pay taxes to support higher education when anti-intellectualism is what the dominant political party is selling.</p>
