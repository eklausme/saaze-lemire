title: "Can you infer tags from text?"
---



The buzz is all about tags these days. [Tagyu](http://kalsey.com/blog/) is an interesting tool which claims to suggest tags based on the text content of the page. I&rsquo;d like to see a description of the algorithm, but I see none.

- http://www.daniel-lemire.com/ gets the tags &ldquo;firefox&rdquo; &ldquo;web2.0&rdquo;. 
- http://www.daniel-lemire.com/en/ gets the tag &ldquo;job&rdquo;.
- http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/ gets the tags &ldquo;france&rdquo; and &ldquo;uqam&rdquo;. 


It seems like the tags for my blog make sense, but the tags for my home pages (French and English) are really bad. Tagging my French home page with &ldquo;france&rdquo;? Maybe because I use the French language? It is a bit of a stretch. Tagging my English home page with &ldquo;job&rdquo;? No. I don&rsquo;t think so.

The problem is interesting and I bet there are solid solutions, but we are not there yet.

I also question whether collaborative tags have a future. I must admit I don&rsquo;t use them, so I won&rsquo;t comment much further, but it is a bit too empirical for my taste.
