title: "8 reasons why I like Gmail"
---



Around a year ago, Google launched it web email service, [Gmail](https://mail.google.com). Since I started using it, I haven&rsquo;t looked back. All my mail goes to my Gmail account, including all university and professional mail.

- You can redirect email arriving at gmail elsewhere. You even have POP access to your gmail account! They are definitively not &ldquo;locking you down&rdquo;.
- You can receive tons of large word and excel attachments. There are two limitations:

- They don&rsquo;t allow messages (incoming or outgoing) larger than 10 MB.
- Irrespective of MIME-type, executables are forbidden, even when they are in a compressed file (gmail knows about .zip, .tar, .tgz, .taz, .z, .gz).


 I have had no trouble with attachments, and I have received and sent word/java/xml/excel files. What it doesn&rsquo;t support are uuencoded attachments, but those have gone out of fashion a long time ago. Note that you can still process an uuencoded attachment&hellip; you just click on &ldquo;show original&rdquo;, you copy and paste the message in a text document, then run &ldquo;uudecode&rdquo; on it. If you have no idea what a uuencoded attachment is, you probably will never learn about them. Only old geeks like me worry about such things.
- It groups discussions in &ldquo;threads&rdquo; and keeps them that way. It takes some doing to get used to it. But it is the right way to manage your emails, at least with a web client.
- The spam filter is excellent. Best I have ever seen.
- They have a nice spell checker.
- Currently, I have 2554 MB of storage and I&rsquo;m using only 844 MB. That&rsquo;s 844 MB with the spam removed, so about a year and half of emails. Notice that Google increases your storage as time goes by though I don&rsquo;t know what algorithm they are using.
- Their search engine is very powerful and very fast.
- You can&rsquo;t send an email to more than 100 people. That&rsquo;s actually a feature since it means spammers can&rsquo;t use Gmail easily.
