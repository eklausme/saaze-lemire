Google open sourced some Python functional programming code : [Google Goopy](http://goog-goopy.sourceforge.net/).

(Got this through [Sean McGrath](https://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/archives/2005_03_13_seanmcgrath_archive.html).)

__Update__: Marcel Ball who now has a [blog](https://theangrynewf.blogspot.com/) and big large scholarship, pointed out to me that [http://code.google.com](https://code.google.com) is a better link to give out.
