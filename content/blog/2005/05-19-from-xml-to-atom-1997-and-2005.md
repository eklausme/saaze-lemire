Tim Bray suggests that [Atom might be the new XML](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/05/19/XML-Atom):

>I find myself pitching Atom to all sorts of different people. What&rsquo;s different is, instead of me pushing at them, I&rsquo;m getting asked &ldquo;Tell me about this Atom stuff.&rdquo; What&rsquo;s the same is that pretty well everyone I pitch to says &ldquo;I could use something like that for&hellip;&rdquo; and what comes after the dots either isn&rsquo;t bloggy at all, or is some weird syndication angle I hadn&rsquo;t thought of.


Ok. I&rsquo;ve written software using RSS and Atom before. To me, Atom appears like a rewrite of RSS. They annoyingly changed the name of some elements that have the same function, but for the most part, I see no progress here.

Can anyone tell me why Atom is such a substantial step forward given that we already had RSS?

A search on &ldquo;why is atom better&rdquo; in google gives me [one result](http://weblogtoolscollection.com/archives/2004/06/02/comparing-rss-20-and-atom-for-the-rest-of-us/). The author basically claims that Atom is better because RSS is tag soup.

I don&rsquo;t see this. Compare my [atom feed](/lemire/blog/feed/atom/) with my [RSS feed](/lemire/blog/feed/). Tell me where they differ so much?

Beside, even if Atom is technically superior, I could still think that the real innovation was RSS.

Trouble is, Tim Bray is a smart man. So, what does he see?
