- He has [4 professors](http://www.trumpinitiative.com/) and all appear credible at first glance.
- Prices are reasonable (it seems): $300 a course.
- There are no degrees offered and the number of courses is currently limited (I see 3 online courses).
- Posting boards and other technologies are used to put the students in touch with each other and with instructors.


Well, there you have it. I can&rsquo;t really criticize this in any way, I think. If they granted degrees, I could wonder whether they are credible, but they don&rsquo;t. If they had no credible Ph.D.-holding professors, I could wonder whether they are credible, but they do. If they only sold static content (like books or access to a static web site), I could wonder whether this isn&rsquo;t a bookstore in disguise, but they actually put students in touch, so they qualify as a virtual campus in my mind.

So, best of luck to you Donald!

__Update:__ I just read Schank&rsquo;s reply to the media. Indeed, how do we know it won&rsquo;t be a good school?
