title: "To fully use your brain, you have to act"

[Will wrote an important blog post](http://www.entish.org/wordpress/?p=173) where he cites a cool study about the fact that the brain represents objects in different manner depending on contexte (where you are seeing it or trying to grab it):

> this work remind[s] us once more that (ultimately) the brain did not evolve to enable us to think; it evolved to enable us to act.


This might explain why merely reading papers about a theory is not the same as working with this theory. Why reading theorems and their proofs is not the same as writting your own proofs. In short, &ldquo;If others do your work, others learn in your place.&rdquo;
