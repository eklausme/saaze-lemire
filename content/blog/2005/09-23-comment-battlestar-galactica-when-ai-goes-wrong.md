<p>I also recently purchased Battlestar Galactica season 1 &#8211; haven&rsquo;t quite finished watching it yet &#8211; 3 episodes left I think. I hadn&rsquo;t really drawn the parallel between the humans in BSG and Americans as you did here, but now that you mention it, it does really seem to come through.</p>
<p>One thing that I also thought to be kind of intersting with the story is that the cylons believe in God, while most of the humans do not; wasn&rsquo;t really the way I would expected that to play out with respect to artifically intelligent man-made beings.</p>
<p>As for hard AI being a bad thing, and if we ever get close to that point we should stop &#8211; I&rsquo;m with you on that. Wasn&rsquo;t BSG that convinced me of that though &#8211; I blame that one of the first matrix movie.</p>
