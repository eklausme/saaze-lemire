<p>Hi,</p>
<p>Did you check out the Pentaho project at <a href="http://www.pentaho.com?" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.pentaho.com?</a></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you would have already known about it, but there was no mention of it in your post.</p>
<p>Claim to be a professional OS company (similar to the jBoss model) trying to put together a complete BI stack using various popular existing products like Mondrian, BizGres(database), jBoss, etc and plugging in their own modules for Dashboard, Data Mining, Workflow, etc.</p>
<p>Seem to have a very ambitious timeline. Seem to be driven by some people with the correct &ldquo;corporate&rdquo; profiles (but then, some of the best OS products came from people with terrible &ldquo;corporate profiles&rdquo; :). We should know by the same time next year whether it has crashed or is heading for market leadership.</p>
<p>cheers,</p>
<p>Ram</p>

<p>You should have a look at PALO (www.palo.net) which is a MOLAP based OLAP Server, with an excel add-in.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice to see the open source olap market moving forward. They are going to have API&rsquo;s in open source languages such as PHP and support open source operating systems such as Linux!</p>
<p>The roadmap is ambitious with planned features such as intercube rules (ie calculated real time elemenets) RTOLAP.</p>
<p>They are planning on offering a very reasonably priced support package, well reasonably priced if you consider the commerical vendors base support on a percentage of the list price of their software (which is often tens or hundreds of thousands)</p>
<p>There is a previous version available from <a href="http://www.palo.net" rel="nofollow ugc">http://www.palo.net</a> along with the excel add-in and a sample C api application.</p>

<p>Yes, there has been an explosion in BI over the last few years business needs intelligence but will open source projects be able to handle that it still remains a question.</p>
