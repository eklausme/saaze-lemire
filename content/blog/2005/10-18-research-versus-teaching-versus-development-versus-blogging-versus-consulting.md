title: "Research versus Teaching versus Development versus Blogging versus Consulting"
---



I&rsquo;m working rather intensively on a new course (Information Retrieval and Filtering) which should be offered in 2006 or 2007. This course is really a pleasure. Normally, teaching is something you do seriously, while you either do as much consulting or as much research as you can. You won&rsquo;t see many university professors spending 60 hours a week preparing a single course. However, sometimes, teaching is something that you can really become passionate about. While I have published work in Information Retrieval, I never paid much attention to the field. Being too busy in my research to stop and start fiddling with more elementary concepts such as the [Zipf law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zipf%27s_Law): where it comes from and what you can do with it. Thanks to [Will Fitzgerald](http://www.entish.org/willwhim/), I now know how to use [n-grams](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/N-gram) and [Shannon&rsquo;s information value](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Information_theory) to determine the language a text is written in. As a researcher, this is highly enjoyable and likely to help my research.
