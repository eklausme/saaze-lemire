<p>Well, your linux problems seem to be a lot easier to fix than mine. I just built a new computer (primarily as a wintendo) &#8211; but decided to try and put linux on there as well &#8211; you know &#8211; so it has a real useful purpose as well. I can boot the install CD (Suse 10.0 OSS edition opensuse.org), and it will dectect my SATA controller and load the driver &#8211; but I won&rsquo;t actually detect that there is a drive attached to the controller.</p>
<p>Going to try some other distros when I get a chance to download them &#8211; hopefully they go a little bit better than this attempt.</p>

<p>Yep. But Linux has improved considerably since when I started (in 2000). It will never be Mac-like, but for some of the work I do, it doesn&rsquo;t need to be Mac-like. This being said, a Mac would be nice, but I do some cool stuff under Linux that I&rsquo;m not willing to give up. However, I&rsquo;m seriously thinking about buying a Mac laptop for the light stuff.</p>

<p>Yeh, this is why I&rsquo;ve switched away from Linux. Mostly. Not entirely, since microphones, music, video, GUIs, etc. are mostly a distraction from my work anyway. But it just got to be too much to have a computer but be unable to use parts of it because of the time investment involved to figure out how to get it to work. I can use Mac OS X, still be on a Unix machine, and have everything work. That leaves me time to waste on other things&#8230;</p>

<p>Well &#8211; I do most of my real work on my mac &#8211; OS X is just an incredible environment to work in &#8211; the power of Unix &#8211; a nice GUI (as well as X when you need it) &#8211; the the fact that it for the most part &ldquo;just works&rdquo;. </p>
<p>But it would have been nice to have a unix like os on my desktop for when I need to do computationally intensive stuff &#8211; an Athlon 64 3500+ is much more powerful than the 1 GHz G4 in my iBook.</p>
