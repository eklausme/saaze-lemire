Steven will be presenting our paper [Analyzing Large Collections of Electronic Text Using OLAP](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/APICS2005.html) at APICS 2005. This work is based on an idea by Owen Kaser:__ what happens if we apply multidimensional databases (OLAP) to literary research?__

 Data Mining and Information Retrieval techniques are used routinely for literary research or processing text in general, but decision support techniques commonly used in the business world (sometimes called &ldquo;Business Intelligence&rdquo;) have not seen much use yet in text processing. The main difference between decision support systems and data mining is the fact that in decision support, __the user remains in control__, thus simple yet extremely efficient algorithms are favoured over sophisticated, but possibly expensive algorithms. __Ideally, all decision support algorithms should be O(1) after accounting for precomputations.__ With infinite storage almost available now, decision support research is due for a technological and scientific boom.

> Computer-assisted reading and analysis of text has various applications in the humanities and social sciences. The increasing size of many electronic text archives has the advantage of a more complete analysis but the disadvantage of taking longer to obtain results. On-Line Analytical Processing is a method used to store and quickly analyze multidimensional data. By storing text analysis information in an OLAP system, a user can obtain solutions to inquiries in a matter of seconds as opposed to minutes, hours, or even days. This analysis is user-driven allowing various users the freedom to pursue their own direction of research.
