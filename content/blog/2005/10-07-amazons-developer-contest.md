Amazon is launching a [web services developer contest](https://www.amazon.com/gp/browse.html/ref=sc_fe_c_2_3435361_4/104-8831386-0492753?%5Fencoding=UTF8&#038;node=15693281&#038;no=3435361&#038;me=A36L942TSJ2AJA):

> Build an innovative and entrepreneurial application using Visual Studio 2005 with Amazon Web Services and you can win the grand prize: $5,000!<br/>
The first 100 entries will receive an Amazon Web Services t-shirt.


The deadline to submit your software application is December 31, 2005. If you ask me, the prizes are not very high, and the requirement that you&rsquo;d be using Visual Studio is a bit sad, but a contest is a contest and if I were a student, I&rsquo;d participate.
