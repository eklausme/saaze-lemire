[Tim Bray follows up on his quest to get people to stop using the slogan Web 2.0 or at least, to agree on what it is](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/08/09/Web-2.0). Here&rsquo;s the gist of it:

> AJAX? Maybe. Tagsonomies? Not yet. Social networks? Not yet. Blogging and Syndication? Definitely


Hmmm&hellip; [Stephen Downes](/lemire/blog/2004/11/18/rss-is-the-semantic-web/) said so much ealier: __RSS is the Semantic Web__. Tim Bray would probably say that Atom is the Semantic Web. Who cares, the message is the same. If there is anything transforming the web right now, it has to do with blogging.
