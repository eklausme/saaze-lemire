<p>Classrooms and universities work precisely because they are an explicit carving out of time for the purpose of learning. I have just about all of the learning resources I need at my hands already, yet I still don&rsquo;t know how to speak Italian. It&rsquo;s because I&rsquo;ve never put forth the time to learn it.</p>
<p>Google is not a competitor to the lecture. Think of graduate school; only the first year or two even involve lectures. Google is just a wonderfully large and accessible library; it&rsquo;s a great tool for the student, as is the lecture, access to the professor and other students, and being in an environment dedicated to learning. </p>
<p>I can think of two of my experiences that drive the point home. The first, when I was 12 or so and refused to memorize formulas for calculating volumes. A substitute math teacher explained the basic concept of calculating volumes (instead of the damned formulas) in about 45 seconds. I haven&rsquo;t forgotten them since. </p>
<p>The second: in graduate school, we cornered <a href="http://www.cs.berkeley.edu/~christos/" rel="nofollow">Christos Papadimitriou</a> as he was attempting to get coffee and had him explain NP completeness one more time. I remember the complete clarity that engulfed me. I understood <b>everything</b> in the world. It lasted about two days. Google can&rsquo;t compete with that.</p>
<p>Now lectures over the web, that&rsquo;s quite attractive, particularly for &ldquo;adult learners&rdquo; such as myself that unfortunately are not involved in academia anymore. </p>

<p>To prove that &ldquo;Google is not a competitor to the lecture&rdquo;, you give two examples, but both of your examples don&rsquo;t imply a &ldquo;classroom lecture&rdquo;. Rather, they imply you are connected with people (a famous scientist and an instructor). I don&rsquo;t see the classroom as an ingredient here. Maybe the school as a &ldquo;meeting place&rdquo;. But not the classroom lecture&#8230;</p>
<p>If the school as a &ldquo;meeting place&rdquo; is the key ingredient here, then let&rsquo;s do away with the classroom and let&rsquo;s organize schools in a way that we can go there just for the sake of chatting with smart people. Maybe a bit like a coffee shop.</p>
<p>Also, most interaction I have with smart people these days is through blogs and emails. Physical meeting places are nice, sometimes useful, but they are also expensive and sometimes a luxury.</p>
<p>Also, to be precise, I did not write that Google was a competitor to the lecture, but if all you do during a lecture is to provide content (static content) then neither of your examples work (because they are interactive examples), and then Google can do it better most of the time.</p>
<p>Want to learn about differential geometry? You can either attend a classroom lecture where a guy will write equations on a board and talk about the topic, or else you can go on Google and type &ldquo;differential geometry&rdquo;. Which one is more efficient? Clearly the second one.</p>
<p>&ldquo;AH! But lectures are interactive&rdquo;, you might object. Maybe. Some of the time. But most of the 50+ students lecture rooms I have seen don&rsquo;t lead to much interaction at all *except* between students. But students know how to interact with each other without the classroom these days: ICQ, email, posting boards&#8230;</p>
<p>Finally, there is the point you are making about your own life. Generally, people can afford classroom lectures up until about 25. Older people can&rsquo;t easily manage these lectures. So, a hidden assumption here is that past 25, you&rsquo;ve learned all you needed to learn. Might have been true in 1960. I doubt it will be true in 2010. I&rsquo;ve learned as much in the last 5 years, than between 15 and 20. I haven&rsquo;t stopped learning, if anything else, I have to learn faster and faster.</p>
