title: "Online courses force a deeper understanding"
---



From eLearn Magazine, I got this [quote](http://elearnmag.acm.org/index.cfm) in a paper by George P. Schell:

>Online courses force a deeper understanding of information technology simply because they require immersion in the technology that supports the subject being taught. If students fail to master the technology skills required by the course they ultimately fail the course itself. We&rsquo;ve long understood that immersion, such as learning a foreign language by living where the language is spoken, is a very effective method for quickly and deeply learning a subject.
