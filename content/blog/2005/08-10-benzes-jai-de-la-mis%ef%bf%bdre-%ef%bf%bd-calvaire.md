My anglo readers don&rsquo;t know this but &ldquo;Daniel Lemire&rdquo; is a famous name in Montreal. There is another &ldquo;Daniel Lemire&rdquo; (beside my father, that is) who is a famous stand-up comedian. He was made famous by some of his nasty quotes. Benzes cites him : (the translation is mine)
```C

There is a lot of trouble in the world.
There are many people in trouble.
And I have a lot of trouble with some people.
```
