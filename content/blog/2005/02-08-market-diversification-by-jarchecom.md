Harold has a good post on Market Diversification:

>In Canada, we continue to focus almost exclusively on exporting to the US. As Godfrey puts it, Wal*Mart does more business with China than all of Canada does. The business development strategies that I see presented at every &ldquo;innovation&rdquo; forum in the region have the same old story presented by analysts, bureaucrats and government. That story is about exporting our products and services to the US. The talk about diversified global markets is negligible. Given the warning signals on the state of the US economy, it would make sense not to put all of our economic eggs in one basket, n&rsquo;est-ce pas?


I think Canada will probably suffer in the coming years given its very intense relationship with the USA. However, we have many young bright Chinese in Canada&hellip;
