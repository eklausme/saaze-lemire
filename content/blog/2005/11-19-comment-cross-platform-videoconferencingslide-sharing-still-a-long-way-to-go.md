<p>Mancomm tested out a number of video conferencing systems this year and really preferred to find something open source but couldn&rsquo;t. I personally am not involved in selling Marratech, but Mancomm (with whom I am associated) is a reseller. </p>
<p>Marratech is comparable to other systems (webex, horizon, elluminate, centra, etc) and it depends on what features you want, so I wouldn&rsquo;t specifically recommend any system over the others. What we liked about Marratech was that 1) it had the features we wanted, 2) it had the most reasonable &amp; transparent pricing model and 3) the company was willing to work with us. Also, one of the founders, Serge LaChapelle, is a Canadian.</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that there will be an OS system ready for at least another year. You could cobble something together with Skype and a few other systems but it would not be the elegant solution that a mathematician would approve of ðŸ˜‰</p>
