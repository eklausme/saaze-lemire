title: "Is Computer Science a Science? A challenge for you!"
---



Is Computer Science a science? My mind is set on this debate and I&rsquo;m not interested in debating it.

Most of my papers have an experimental section, but does it follow I do science? Actually, I spend a lot of time crafting my experiments so it is an integral part of my research. However, most of these experiments follow the reverse scientific method: I seek experimental evidence to support my claims or to quantify more precisely my theoretical results. I&rsquo;m not alone since I very rarely see papers in Computer Science whose point is to falsify a theory someone promoted. You just don&rsquo;t see these types of paper. Other times, when I&rsquo;m not publishing papers, I simply hack: I use technology in beautiful ways. It used to say on this blog that I am a hacker. It still says so in my RSS feeds and it is still true. But I think I&rsquo;m a hacker in the noble sense of the word since I&rsquo;ve never hacked into someone&rsquo;s system. I think the Semantic Web, if it succeeds, will be a giant and beautiful hack. But I don&rsquo;t think it will be part of a scientific theory.

 However, I&rsquo;m interested in issuing a challenge. Let&rsquo;s assume that the Semantic Web is a scientific theory or, at least, a set of scientific hypothesis. By the virtues of the scientific method, these hypothesis must be falsifiable. Hence, it must be possible to falsify the Semantic Web. Can you describe a set of experiments testing whether the scientific hypothesis underlying the Semantic Web hold? Once you are done, repeat with related topics like [Learning Objects](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Learning_object) .

__Note__: Among other things, I&rsquo;m helping to organize the [2006 Canadian Symposium on Semantic Web](http://www.ift.ulaval.ca/~kone/SWIG06/) and I recently [wrote a paper on learning objects](http://www.daniel-lemire.com/fr/abstracts/ITSE2005.html) so don&rsquo;t come blasting through my door yet if you are working on these topics and think they are worthy of consideration.
