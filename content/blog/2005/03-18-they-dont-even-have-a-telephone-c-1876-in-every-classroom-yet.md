Harold has a beautiful post on the fact that technology and new media don&rsquo;t fit in the classroom:

>All of the action is outside the classroom &#8211; blogs, wikis, IM, podcasting &#8211; you name it. Soon, the only place to get away from media will be inside the classroom. Hey, they don&rsquo;t even have a telephone (c. 1876) in every classroom yet.



Classrooms used to have books in them. Books were the best learning technology available.Now, the best learning technology is on the Web, but the Web is not in the classroom.

So, when will classrooms be obselete? Or are they already obselete?
