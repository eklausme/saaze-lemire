From [Slashdot](http://news.slashdot.org/story/05/01/13/149224/creative-commons-remix-contest) comes mention of a [Creative Commons Remix Contest](http://ccmixter.org/) where, from what I understand, people are invited to submit remixed music under a liberal license and the winner will get his music pressed on a CD. It seems like this is derived from work started by Lucas Gonze of WebJay fame.
