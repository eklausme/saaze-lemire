I just read a great paper in the Chronical called Evaluation and the Culture of Secrecy:

> For years now, I&rsquo;ve been waging a private battle against the unexamined practice of confidentiality. When I write readers&rsquo; reports, I add a postscript requesting that the press or journal attach my name to the evaluation. Then I hope it does so. I add my request for openness to my tenure-evaluation letters too.


What an eye-opener!!! Our current academic system with all its secret evaluations takes a lot from the CIA and Al Quaida, but very little from the justice system.
For years now, I&rsquo;ve been annoyed that my paper reviews are anonymous. In many cases, I&rsquo;ve had the feeling that such or such review was motivated politically (I didn&rsquo;t cite the right people). I&rsquo;ve also heard many horror stories about promotion cases going sour for unknown pr unexplainable reasons. Like many people, I no longer really trust the system. I used to trust it when I was a graduate student. I believed that people did their best to manage the system, but now, I strongly suspect that many decisions are bias and people get away with it because of the secrecy.

What changed today is that I realized that I can do something about it. I can request that the reviews I write bear my name.
