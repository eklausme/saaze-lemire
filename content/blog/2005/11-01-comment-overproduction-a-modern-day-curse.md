<p>When I moved to Canada from Southern Africa back in 1986, I was given Globe and Mail and Toronto Star in the flight. One thing I distictly remember about these papers were how boring the writing was! First of all, the papers contained more than 60-70% ads. The rest of the articles were written by very bad writers. I had to force myself to read these newspapers. No wonder why the circulation of news media is going down in north America. Contrast this with South African paper. Relatively, they cost a lot more (5 rands when I last bought them, when teachers were making 600 rands per month). It is difficult to put down these papers when you start reading them.</p>
