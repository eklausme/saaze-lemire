<p>Interesting to see your continued concern about universities and their role and importance going forward. I have good news for you: qualifications are very important.</p>
<p>I regularly hire people into a company that&rsquo;s about as innovative and fast changing as they get. One of the first things we look at is what school the candidate went to and what they studied. In our scenario, where there are many more resumes to look at than candidates we&rsquo;ll accept, schooling is a first order filter. In truth, it&rsquo;s difficult to get in here unless you went to a good school, no matter how talented you are, since your resume won&rsquo;t make it past the first filter. </p>
<p>Of course if someone has 10 years of experience in the field and has demonstrated excellence, that&rsquo;s a different story. But for someone graduating from college, believe me, your qualifications matter a great deal.</p>
<p>To be clear, I&rsquo;m not talking about certification in some technology or another; I&rsquo;m talking about a degree from a reputable school. </p>
