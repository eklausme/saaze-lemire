Through Harold, I found this [quote by Seth Godin](http://sethgodin.typepad.com/seths_blog/2005/01/the_google_watc.html) regarding the recent events (Google hired a key Firefox developer):

1. Running a successful open source effort is a great idea. I can&rsquo;t think of an individual who has invested the time and not had a great personal outcome as well.

2. Google understands what I failed to persuade Yahoo! of a long time ago&#8211;owning the browser is a home run. Microsoft has botched their ownership of IE, because they think like bullies, and you can&rsquo;t bully consumers into doing what they don&rsquo;t want to do. The idea of a Google browser is powerful from both a user and a commercial perspective, mainly because Google&rsquo;s culture will make it work.
