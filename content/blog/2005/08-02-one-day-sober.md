title: "One day sober!"
---



I&rsquo;ve stopped coffee. Not one shot yesterday. I got a terrible headache, and toward the end of the day, I felt like throwing up. But I feel much better today.

My beautiful wife bought me some decaf this morning, so I&rsquo;ll get some of the taste, but hopefully without the addiction.

Interestingly, I don&rsquo;t lack energy or stress. I&rsquo;m quite stressed by all the things I have to do actually. So why take coffee? My job isn&rsquo;t boring&hellip; I have an exciting and difficult job and should have no trouble staying awake.
