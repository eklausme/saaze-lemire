title: "ACM Queue &ndash; A Conversation with Tim Bray"
---



This is brilliant! [ACM Queue is publishing an interview with Tim Bray (of XML fame)](http://queue.acm.org/detail.cfm?id=1046941) done by Jim Gray (of data cube and database transactions fame). Tim now runs Web technologies for Sun Microsystems. Tim Bray basically says that RDF and Semantic Web are a no go but we knew that&rsquo;s what he thought.
However, there are many cool quotes. Try to find the pattern in these:

>My CEO, Tom Jenkins, agreed to turn me loose to work on it myself, and I spent six months basically doing nothing else and built the crawler and the interfaces. (&hellip;) I lost weeks and weeks and weeks of sleep, hacking and patching and kludging to keep this thing on the air under the pressure of the load.



>Lark was the first XML processor, implemented in Java. I wrote it myself. I used it also as a vehicle to learn Java. It shipped in January 1997 and actually got used by a bunch of people. (&hellip;) So, I let Lark go. It was fun to write and I think it was helpful, but it hasn&rsquo;t been maintained since 1998.


>Some of the people working in syndication were extremely upset about XML&rsquo;s strictness, saying, â€œWell, you know, people just can&rsquo;t be expected to generate well-formed data.â€ And I said, â€œYes they can.â€ I went looking around and found that there are some quite decent libraries capable of doing that for Java and Perl and Python, but there didn&rsquo;t seem to be one for C.

So sitting on the beach in Australia I wrote this little library in C called Genx that generates XML efficiently and guarantees that it is well-formed and canonical.



See the pattern? Tim Bray is a hacker with a degree in mathematics and computer science. [[Tim doesn&rsquo;t have a graduate degree.](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/04/14/Doctor-Sass)] And he changed the world.

But his life was not always easy:

>Microsoft really went insane. There was a major meltdown and a war, and I was temporarily fired as XML coeditor. There was an aggressive attempt to destroy my career over that.



(Note that the interviewer, Jim Gray, works for Microsoft!)
