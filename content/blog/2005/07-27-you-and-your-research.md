title: "You and Your Research"

Through the [Geomblog](http://blog.geomblog.org/2005/07/i-dont-want-to-know-that-much-about.html), I got to a post in &ldquo;Lowerbounds, Upperbounds&rdquo; which reproduces a speech given by Hamming. Here&rsquo;s what Hamming had to say about great researchers:

> I claim that some of the reasons why so many people who have greatness within their grasp don&rsquo;t succeed are: they don&rsquo;t work on important problems, they don&rsquo;t become emotionally involved, they don&rsquo;t try and change what is difficult to some other situation which is easily done but is still important, and they keep giving themselves alibis why they don&rsquo;t.


What is also interesting is that Hamming was probably not a very happy man:

>  I had incipient ulcers most of the years that I was at Bell Labs. I have since gone off to the Naval Postgraduate School and laid back somewhat, and now my health is much better. But if you want to be a great scientist you&rsquo;re going to have to put up with stress. You can lead a nice life; you can be a nice guy or you can be a great scientist. But nice guys end last, is what Leo Durocher said. If you want to lead a nice happy life with a lot of recreation and everything else, you&rsquo;ll lead a nice life.


Nice guys end last. Right. Are we to understand that bad guys end first? Right. Fun.
