title: "Why I think a lot of Machine Learning research is misguided"

[Suresh has this to say about some Machine Learning algorithms (neural nets and genetic algorithms)](http://blog.geomblog.org/2005/09/no-free-lunch-theorems.html):

> I dislike them greatly though because they are extremely general hammers that typically don&rsquo;t have provably performance or running time guarantees, and don&rsquo;t reveal any interesting insights into the structure of a problem.


He then goes on to state an instance of the &ldquo;No Free Lunch&rdquo; theorem that says that all generic learning algorithms are the same.

To me, the main argument against some generic Machine Learning algorithms is that they &ldquo;don&rsquo;t reveal any interesting insights into the structure of a problem&rdquo;. In some way, some of Machine Learning research has become a form of anti-science. Science is about finding patterns, going down under the surface and make some underlying, often hidden structures, emerge. Science is not about solving problems; that&rsquo;s what engineering is for.

In French, &ldquo;researcher&rdquo; is &ldquo;chercheur&rdquo; which could be translated as &ldquo;searcher&rdquo;. My father used to joke that he would much rather hire a &ldquo;finder&rdquo; than a &ldquo;searcher&rdquo;. Back as an undergraduate, I tended to agree with him: researchers should be people solving hard problems. Now, I would disagree. My function, when I do research, is not to solve problems. Solving the problems is only a secondary side-effect to my research work. One way to do research happens to involve the process of solving a problem, usually using the simplest and most elegant approach possible.
