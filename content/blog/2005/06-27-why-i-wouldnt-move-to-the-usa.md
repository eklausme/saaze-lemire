title: "Why I wouldnÂ´t move to the USA"
---



I can see it from here&hellip; I&rsquo;m a nice, gentle Canadian citizen. I go work in the States for a few years and while I&rsquo;m there, I&rsquo;m tagged as a terrorist. Maybe because I said something nasty about someone on my blog. I end up in jail and I am labelled as an enemy combatant. Of course, there is no shrewd of evidence against me, but who needs to prove anything?

[Ernie&rsquo;s 3D Pancake](http://3dpancakes.typepad.com/ernie/2005/06/oh_emtortureem_.html) reminds me of what could happen then:

> Washington&rsquo;s report to the Committee reaffirms the US position that the Guantanamo detainees are classed as &ldquo;enemy combatants,&rdquo; and therefore do not benefit from the POW status set out in the Geneva Conventions, the Committee member said.


That&rsquo;s right. The US military can torture POWs. I&rsquo;m sure the next time an American soldier is captured, the enemy will remember about this. Of course, American citizens don&rsquo;t care about a few foreigners. Hey! They still have the death penalty!!!

Isn&rsquo;t the USA a christian state&hellip; didn&rsquo;t Jesus say something about offering the second cheek?

If you are an American citizen, explain to me how you can allow your government to openly torture people. Not that I&rsquo;m expecting the USA to take the high road on anything these days, but openly torture POWs is a bit much for my taste.
