title: "A future in IT? Think about IT security!"
---



Cringely predicts certified security experts will see a rapid appreciation of their value. I agree. It is quite an obvious prediction, but well worth stating in an era where IT experts are often struggling. Can a job in IT security be interesting, be fun? I don&rsquo;t know.

All and in all, there is clearly a bright future for IT experts, but you&rsquo;ve got to go do the difficult stuff: security and data warehousing.
