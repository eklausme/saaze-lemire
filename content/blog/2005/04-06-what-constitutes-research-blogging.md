[Mathemagenic discusses research blogging](http://blog.mathemagenic.com/2005/04/06.html#a1533) and __she__ found, based on __her__ experience, that research blogging covers the following tasks:

- publishing / dissemination / announcements (of papers, presentations, events by me and others) 
- research process

- reflections
- emotions

<li>event blogging

- notes 
- reflections 
- event planning (including travel planning)

<li>paper blogging (notes on papers I read) 
<li>asking for help (explicit) 
<li>&ldquo;enculturation&rdquo; into research (reflection/learning on research culture, practices, tricks of the trade, etc.) 
<li>articulation

- articulation of personal experiences (relevant for PhD) 
- articulation of problems/questions (may be implicit call for help, but often just thinking aloud)

<li>writing-related (this is the difficult one)

- drafting/testing pieces that supposed to go into a&nbsp;paper 
- giving space to pieces that do not fit into a paper

<li>reflections on methodology
