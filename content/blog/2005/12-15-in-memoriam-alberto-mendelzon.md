title: "In Memoriam, Alberto Mendelzon"
---



[Alberto Mendelzon](https://www.uhasselt.be/Fout-pagina---Error-page) died this summer. He was the original author of the [OLAP and Data Warehousing bibliography I maintain](https://lemire.me/OLAP/). While I never got to meet him, or at least, I don&rsquo;t think so, he was a great researcher and an inspiration. Owen points me to a page at the University of Toronto in Memoriam of Mendelzon.
