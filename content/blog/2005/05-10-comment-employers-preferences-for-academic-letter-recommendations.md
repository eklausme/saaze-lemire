<p>I dont know if it means that much, the survey was not about all the employers. Check this quote about the method they used:</p>
<p>&ldquo;A cover letter describing the study and a questionnaire were mailed to 600 Information Systems (IS) Managers, Directors, and VP&rsquo;s of companies randomly selected from NASDAQ.&rdquo;</p>
