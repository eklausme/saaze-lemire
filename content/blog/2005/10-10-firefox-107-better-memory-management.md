title: "Firefox 1.0.7: better memory management?"
---



I love Firefox, but one thing that&rsquo;s causing me grief is its memory leakage. On my gentoo box, Firefox 1.0.6 would quickly eat up to 55% of my available memory. I had to kill Firefox every two days to get my machine working. I&rsquo;ve upgraded to 1.0.7 yesterday, and it runs smoothly using __only__ 25% of my available memory (according to &ldquo;top&rdquo;). Given that my browser is arguably the most important software application running on my machine and given that I&rsquo;m unlikely at any one time to run two browsers, I don&rsquo;t care if firefox uses up to 25% of my memory, but please, no more. When I&rsquo;m not browsing the web, I&rsquo;ve got to do real work like research and teaching. Interestingly, the [release notes don&rsquo;t mention anything about improved memory usage](http://www.mozilla.org/products/firefox/releases/1.0.7.html). Also, my Mandrake box (running 10.1) doesn&rsquo;t seem to have this problem, nor do my windows boxes, irrespective of the Firefox version number. Anyhow, I&rsquo;m crossing my fingers, hoping that Firefox will be well behaved this time.
