title: "High demand for storage"

In [What was Sun thinking?](http://9news.i.com.com/) (CNET News.com), Charles Cooper tells us that storage is now in high demand:

>What with some of the confusing&#8211;make that idiotic&#8211;federal regulations governing corporate behavior that have appeared the last couple years, there&rsquo;s a near bottomless demand for big storage systems. After the passage of Sarbanes-Oxley and HIPAA, CEOs are so keen on covering their posteriors these days that there&rsquo;s no such thing as too much documentation. Identity and management access is the hot ticket these days as every management team worth its salt wants to tout how tough it now is on compliance.



Wow. Seems like it is going to be a nice era for data warehousing and OLAP, no?
