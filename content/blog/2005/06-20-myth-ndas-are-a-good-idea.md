title: "MYTH: NDAs are a Good Idea"
---



Thanks to [Downes](http://www.downes.ca), I found this beautiful post on why asking for a NDA is like screaming that you are clueless. This comes back to the unnecessary lack of openess I complain about. For every guy willing to implement an idea, you have a thousand ideas out there if not more. Ideas are simply not that valuable.

What was Microsoft idea? You think it was to create DOS and sell it to IBM&rsquo;s customer. No way! This only came onto them. Take any successful venture, look at the idea behind it and you&rsquo;ll notice that it was either wrong or not that brilliant.

Good idea are not important, good people are. An idea without the brain holding it is __nothing__.

This is why we have universities and not merely libraries, btw.
