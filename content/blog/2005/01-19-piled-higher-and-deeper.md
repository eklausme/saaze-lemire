Thanks to [geomblog](http://blog.geomblog.org/) I found out there is such a thing as [daily comics](http://www.phdcomics.com/comics/comics.php) about working on a Ph.D. It is pretty funny though I was so among the lucky ones when I wrote my Ph.D.: I was very naÃ¯ve. 

What I want to see is a follow-up where the Ph.D. student actually gets a job!

I read [somewhere](http://www.fcar.qc.ca/nateq/pdf_general/Renforcer%20le%20Qu%E9bec.pdf) last night that according to a study, only 15% of Ph.D.s in science working in Québec (Canada) are on a professorship (Canada). It can be either a good or a bad thing. As for myself, after a got my Ph.D., I never could find a decent job offer in Québec that wasn&rsquo;t a professorship. I know few jobs that are quite good outside academia, but I certainly don&rsquo;t know many. Where are all those Ph.D.s and are they happy?
