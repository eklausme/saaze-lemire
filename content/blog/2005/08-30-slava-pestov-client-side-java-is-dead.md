title: "Slava Pestov : Client-side Java is dead"
---



There is exactly one Java application I use routinely, [jedit](http://www.jedit.org). It is an excellent text editor. As it turns out, the author doesn&rsquo;t think too highly of Java itself:

> I wonder how an extensively hyped piece of software like Java 1.5 &#8212; Sun told us it was &ldquo;the most stable Java release ever&rdquo; &#8212; could be shipped out the door with such critical bugs. Anybody who is still attempting to do client-side development in Java is either retarded, a clueless summer intern working at Sun, or both. This must be why after 8 years of (broken) promises regarding Swing and client-side Java, there are exactly zero Java applications in wide use.


I agree with Slava. Java is a terrible platform for client-side work. Applets died quite some time ago, but now, the remaining client-side applications will live a slow, painful death.

Note: I still use Java extensively, but not for developing anything that looks like client-side applications. Yet, I seriously worry about Java&rsquo;s future on the server as well&hellip; but this will be for another post&hellip;
