<p>Gmail has really been improving lately.</p>
<p>The space has been increasing, about 1 extra GB on April 1st, and it&rsquo;s been constantly increasing by a slow amount since then (about 2 or 3 MB a day now) &#8211; you actually should be upto 2058. </p>
<p>Additionaly they have recently rich text editing (which i hate personally, but some seem to like) and a basic html interface (that is still better than webmail interfaces) that works with browsers that have less than perfect javascript support.</p>
