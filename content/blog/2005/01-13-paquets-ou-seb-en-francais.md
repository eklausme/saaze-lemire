title: "Paquets&#8230; ou Seb en franÃ§ais"
---



Seb is now available in French through [Paquets&hellip; de quoi?](http://www.blogsome.com/) Multi-language blogging is an interesting topic I covered elsewhere in my blog. I will eventually open a blog in French, but I&rsquo;m worried that having too many blogs will kill the fun. I like having one spot to call mine&hellip; if I have to run around all over the place, it might get tiring&hellip;
