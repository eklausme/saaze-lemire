[Google Blog Search is out](https://www.google.com/?gws_rd=ssl). You have Atom/RSS feeds for your favorite queries:

> Can I subscribe to search results?

Yes. At the bottom of each page of search results you can find several links, offering the top 10 or 100 results as either Atom or RSS feeds. Just grab the links from here and subscribe to them in the news aggregator of your choice and you will get updates whenever new posts are made that match your query.
