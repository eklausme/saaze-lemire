title: "Gmail: How do I customize the `From:´ address on outgoing mail?"
---



Ok, the real reason behind this post is so I can easily find the link on how to change the &ldquo;From&rdquo; address in Gmail. The other reason of this post is to observe that Gmail is translated in about 50 languages, but they cheat. If you switch to French, you no longer can switch your &ldquo;From&rdquo; address as the &ldquo;account&rdquo; tab no longer appears under &ldquo;settings&rdquo; (&ldquo;paramÃ¨tres&rdquo; in French).

I suspect that how it works is that Gmail automatically disables features that are not translated. This differs considerably from the way most people localize applications: the default would be for English to start appearing, or worse, empty strings.

How can Google develop software differently from anyone else, even in the little details?
