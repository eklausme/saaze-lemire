title: "Google mail allow you to view attachments as HTML"
---



I noticed recently that Google mail allows you to [view attachements as HTML](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/30719?query=%22view+as+html%22&amp;topic=0&amp;type=f). This is a great feature. The last thing I want to do when reading an email in my browser is to launch Word. Google mail allows you to view the following file formats as html: .pdf, .doc, .xls, .ppt, .rtf, .sxw, .sxc, .sxi, .sdw, .sdc, .sdd, and .wml. 

Missing from their list is the [OpenDocument](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/OpenDocument) format which was recently adopted by the State of Massachusetts as the required format.
