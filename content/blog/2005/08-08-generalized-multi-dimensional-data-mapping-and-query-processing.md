title: "Generalized Multi-dimensional Data Mapping and Query Processing"

Rui Zhang, a student at the University of Singapore, made available his Generalized Multi-dimensional Data Mapping and Query Processing software package as a tar ball. I started browsing the related paper (Generalized Multi-dimensional Data Mapping and Query Processing. TODS, September 2005) and it is interesting work, if you care about UB-Trees and this sort of stuff (OLAP-related).
