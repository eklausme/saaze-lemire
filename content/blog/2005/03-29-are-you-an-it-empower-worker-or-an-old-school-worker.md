title: "Are you an IT-empower worker or an old school worker?"
---



Harold has a good post on what knowledge workers want. I&rsquo;m turning it into a test&hellip; see in the table below whether you an IT-empower worker or not&hellip; I score 4 out 4 as an IT-empower worker.

old school worker        |IT-empower worker        |
-------------------------|-------------------------|
I can&rsquo;t find anything. |I can find most things.  |
I get what I need more effectively from conversations. |I get most of what I need from general written conversations and specific oral conversations &#8211; online (though I still like face-to-face discussions). |
Knowledge gathering isn&rsquo;t the best use of my time. |Knowledge gathering is a good use of some of my time because I&rsquo;ve developed a few efficient processes.
                         |
I prefer private knowledge stocks that I don&rsquo;t trust others enough to share. |I still keep some private knowledge stocks, but use the public ones more often. |


I would add a few of my own&hellip;

-------------------------|-------------------------|
I mostly use commercial software installed and maintained by someone else. |I find and manage my own software, mostly free software. |
Most software application I use are desktop applications: I spend 97% of my time in Microsoft Office. |Most software I use is Web-based. |
I&rsquo;m getting nervous when people suggest we use a Wiki: what&rsquo;s wrong with Microsoft Word? |I run my own wikis.      |
A blog? I&rsquo;ve got nothing to say and I prefer to preserve my privacy. |My blog is one of my key knowledge management tools. |
My projects are mostly with nearby colleagues. |My office is the worldwide though I work from my basement. |


A very large fraction of my colleagues are &ldquo;old school workers&rdquo;. How is it that I don&rsquo;t feel more productive than they are? Is there any concrete benefit to being IT-empowered? It seems to me that as with each passing year, I&rsquo;ve got more and more to read and my schedule is not getting any lighter. In many ways, my blog makes me smarter, but I just can&rsquo;t point to the benefits in my daily life. I&rsquo;d like to.
