[Paul Graham says that transparency (and thus data recording) is the way out of corruption](http://www.paulgraham.com/inequality.html):

> How do you break the connection between wealth and power? Demand transparency. Watch closely how power is exercised, and demand an account of how decisions are made. Why aren&rsquo;t all police interrogations videotaped? Why did 36% of Princeton&rsquo;s class of 2007 come from prep schools, when only 1.7% of American kids attend them? Why did the US really invade Iraq? Why don&rsquo;t government officials disclose more about their finances, and why only during their term of office?


This is very important. Being rich brings you security, but not a lot of power if you have to go through the same process as everyone else. A just society is an open society where we record everything.

Big Brother might actually be the ticket to a just society.
