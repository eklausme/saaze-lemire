title: "The fate of reduce() in Python 3000"
---



I learned from [Will](https://willwhim.blogspot.com/) that [Guido is taking out functional programming functions from Python](http://www.artima.com/weblogs/viewpost.jsp?thread=98196)

>About 12 years ago, Python aquired lambda, reduce(), filter() and map(), courtesy of (I believe) a Lisp hacker who missed them and submitted working patches. But, despite of the PR value, I think these features should be cut from Python 3000.


This doesn&rsquo;t say that functional programming will disappear, just that Guido is cleaning up the language. You&rsquo;ll still be able to cleanly pass functions as arguments.
