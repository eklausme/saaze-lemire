title: "Make your publications available as a RSS feed"
---



A long time ago, I turned my [publication list](https://lemire.me/en/publications.html) into an [RSS feed](http://feeds.feedburner.com/DanielLemiresArticlesOnArxiv). To my knowledge, I&rsquo;m the first researcher to have done so. It came to me today that I should probably claim this innovation now before other people start doing it.

If everyone I care about did it, I could monitor publications in a researcher-centric way, not in a publisher-centric way. It would be much better for me, and much better for the researchers I care about.
