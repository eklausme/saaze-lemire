<p>Anonymous: XML Schema is not RelaxNG.</p>
<p>XPointer could indeed be tremendously useful *if* browsers and various other tools supported it.</p>
<p>XQuery may be attractive, but the number of people who won&rsquo;t learn XSLT because it is to foreign to them, but will learn XQuery because they need to process XML is small. XSLT is simply a more general, more potent solution and it is supported everywhere (at least XSLT 1.0).</p>
<p>RDF is abstract, complex and dry, I agree.</p>

<p>XML Schema = RelaxNG ???</p>
<p>How about Xpointer?? Works well with Xpath&#8230;.</p>
<p>XQuery, yes but it sure does llok attractive to manipulate documents against each other like that, no?</p>
<p>RDF, abstract, complex and dry. Again, really attractive.</p>
