title: "IT Curriculum Committee Seeks Input on Guidelines"

[ACM IT Curriculum Committee is seeking feedback regarding its preliminary report](http://membernet.acm.org/?ci=July_2005&amp;announcement=3&amp;CFID=49408826&amp;CFTOKEN=90675088). Basically, they describe what a 4-year degree in IT should look like.

> In the report, IT is defined as an academic discipline that encompasses all aspects of computing technology. As a discipline, IT focuses on &ldquo;meeting the needs of users within an organizational and societal context through the selection, creation, application, integration and administration of computing technologies.&rdquo;


The report is very long (over a 100 pages) and the stupid &ldquo;draft&rdquo; image on each page makes it harder to browse.

This makes me hopeful that IT will grow to become a respectable discipline.

To me, this is one half of Computer Science jobs, the other half being Software Engineering-related. However, IT is hard to outsource, is needed by almost all companies and can be a key component of a smart company.

Reading the report, it looks like programs following this guideline will be both fun and challenging.
