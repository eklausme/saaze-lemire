[Will Whim points us to a BASIC interpreter working in your Firefox 1.5+ browser.](http://www.entish.org/wordpress/?p=291) I tried it and it took a really long time to start and the fonts are just way too small for my tired eyes, but it works and reminds me of the good old Microsoft BASIC implementation from when Microsoft meant command line software.

Yesterday, I found the an online Ruby shell and Will points us to an [online Lisp interpreter](http://www.joeganley.com/code/jslisp.html).

Maybe my sons will learn to __program__ in a browser&hellip; if there are still browsers in 10 to 15 years.
