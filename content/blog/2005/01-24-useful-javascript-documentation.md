title: "Useful JavaScript documentation"

I can&rsquo;t find these on my blog anymore, so I&rsquo;m reposting them. I complained earlier that JavaScript is poorly documented. My friend Scott Flinn gave me some useful links that are hard to come by (Google doesn&rsquo;t find them quickly for me):

>If you need DOM documentation for XML (XHTML in Gecko<br/>
is treated as pure XML), you will find it here:

- [http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) 
- [ http://www.mozilla.org/docs/dom/domref/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Document_Object_Model) 


A few other useful links are here:

- [http://www.mozilla.org/docs/web-developer/](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/Guide)




However, a found another good site: http://www.xulplanet.com/references/objref/
