title: "Editing forms in Firefox"
---



Firefox has cool free extensions. I now use text forms more often than text processors, so I need some features, the extensions provide them.

- Textareatools gives you search and replace.
- [Spellbound](http://spellbound.sourceforge.net/) gives you spell checking in forms, but it is a pain to install.
