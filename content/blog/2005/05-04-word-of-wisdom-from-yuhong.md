[Yuhong reflects on the different ways people approach research](https://flydragony.blogspot.com/2005/05/academic-in-old-world-and-new-world.html), and she has this conclusion:

>Anyway, for most of the researchers, research is a career that needs to manage and exploit. Many are hardworking craftsmen, instead of being a master. I would like to suggest that instead of working hard as a bee to accumulate the publication list and funding, it is better to enjoy your life if you do not have splendid ideas to work on.
