This article in the Chronicle takes on the debate as to whether women are genetically predisposed to do poorly in mathematics. I like this quote:

> 
The researchers found that, in general, mathematically gifted females had broader abilities than did mathematically talented males. 


If you ask me, this rings true. Math girls do exist: they just happen to also be good at other things than math.

And the question that never gets asked: why do we necessarily want more women in science and mathematics? Isn&rsquo;t it cool that women are increasingly present in law and medecine?

In Quebec, we have more women than men in medicine, education, law and so on&hellip; would we also want to have more women in science and mathematics?

The only answer I can give is that if we had more women in science and mathematics, we would have more people altogether in science and mathematics. This would be a good thing for science and mathematics professors (including me).
