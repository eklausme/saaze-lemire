If you are into Business Intelligence, this might interest you: the 2005 QlikView Think Outside The Cube Contest is open.

>  We&rsquo;re inviting you to â€œThink Outside The Cubeâ€ and move beyond the limits of traditional OLAP-based BI.Your application/entry can be a QlikView application that covers anything &#8211; results and statistics from a favorite sport, stock tracking, movies, fantasy football, financial results from obscure stock exchanges, your kids&rsquo; swim team times, the price of tea in China. Anything that generates data is fair game.


(Organized by QlikTech.)
