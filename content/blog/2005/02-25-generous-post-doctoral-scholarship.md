I learned about something called the BURROUGHS WELLCOME FUND (BWF) which offers funding for post-doctoral work. You must have a science or engineering Ph.D. and not have more than 2 years of post-doctoral experience. It seems to fund you for 5 years which seems cool.

Details: here is a note about it on UQAM&rsquo;s web site.
