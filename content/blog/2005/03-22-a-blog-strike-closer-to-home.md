title: "A blog strike closer to home"
---



A blog is really about being yourself, or at least, feeling at home. I think that people who really get into it are people who really manage to create a home for themselves. My blog is really much more my home than my stupid home page. A home page is more like a front&hellip; it is what my home looks like from a distance&hellip; my blog is what my home is like inside. Sure, I may have cleaned up a bit before you came in&hellip; and I may not invite you in my bedroom on the first night&hellip; but you strike closer to home than you do with the static home page.
