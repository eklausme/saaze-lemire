title: "Die trackback, die!"
---



From now on, all trackbacks to this blog are moderated thanks to the [moderate-trackbacks](https://plugins.trac.wordpress.org/browser/moderate-trackbacks/) plugins. Spammers have really a lot of time to waste. Good thing the wordpress community is very strong and fighting back.

Now, the simplest thing is: do not to use trackback. It is a weak protocol (in a spam infested world) and I&rsquo;ll probably not moderate these very often especially if the queue gets very long. Ping my blog instead ([pingback specs](http://www.hixie.ch/specs/pingback/pingback) make spamming difficult).

__Update__: Downes has a recent post on a related topic: Trackback is Dead, Use PubSub (though I published this post before he published his!).

__Update 2__: about 2 hours after installing the plugin, I&rsquo;ve got 18 trackback deleted. This is 9 spams an hour. And I&rsquo;m a low traffice web site&hellip;
