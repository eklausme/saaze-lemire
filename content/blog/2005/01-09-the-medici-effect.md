Harold talks about the The Medici Effect:

>Johansson tells you to look for reversals which may give you insights into new ways of doing things. He uses a restaurant as an example, saying that the assumption is that restaurants have menus, but the reversal would be a restaurant without a menu. This would be one where, &ldquo;The chef informs each customer what he bought that day &hellip; the diner selects the desired food items and the chef creates a dish from them, specifically for each customer.&rdquo;



I never tried this reversal approach, but it appears interesting. Maybe I do it without realizing it&hellip; I&rsquo;ll experiment!

He also says to work on a problem, let it go, then come back to it. Well, I&rsquo;m an expert at this approach, except that sometimes, I never come back&hellip; ðŸ˜‰
