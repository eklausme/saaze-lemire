MySQL 5.0 is out. It now supports:

- Stored Procedures and SQL Functions (about time!);
- Triggers (about time!);
- Views (about time!);
- Cursors (about time!);
- Information Schema &#8212; to provide easy access to metadata (I don&rsquo;t know what this is);
- XA Distributed Transactions &#8212; supports complex transactions across multiple databases in heterogeneous environments (sounds good);
- SQL Mode &#8212; provides server-enforced data integrity for new and existing data (about time!).


However, I wouldn&rsquo;t switch over any serious Enterprise project to MySQL with Oracle buying InnoDB and all, but if you are already using MySQL, this is good news indeed.
