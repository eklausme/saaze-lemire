In relation to a [previous post of mine about open source Business Intelligence](/lemire/blog/2005/08/03/bi-is-ready-for-open-source-is-open-source-ready-for-bi/#comments) where I wrote &ldquo;So, maybe someone out there should start a support company for Open Source Business Intelligence?&rdquo;, Krishnaswamy Ram pointed out to [Pentaho ](http://www.pentaho.com/) which seems to be exactly what I had imagined a smart businessman could do.

> The Pentaho BI Project provides enterprise-class reporting, analysis, dashboard, data mining and workflow capabilities that help organizations operate more efficiently and effectively. The software offers flexible deployment options that enable use as embeddable components, customized BI application solutions, and as a complete out-of-the-box, integrated BI platform.
