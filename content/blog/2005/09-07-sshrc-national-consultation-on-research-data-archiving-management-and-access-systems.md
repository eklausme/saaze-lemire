One of the big founding councils in Canada, SSHRC, is looking at an [open acces policy and Stephen Downes is asking us to voice our opinions.](http://www.downes.ca/cgi-bin/page.cgi?post=21454)

If funding agencies start requiring open access, publishers could be in for a big change. They might be powerful compared to the average scientist trying to publish-or-perish, but the little scientist who must offer open access to his publications to keep his grant will suddenly grow some teeth.

Would I risk my federal grant for the whims of a publisher like IEEE? Never.

Once we have open access to most significant publications, the research game may change dramatically. In fields like Computer Science, it would make little difference, but I hear that philosophers are still very old fashioned about their publications.
