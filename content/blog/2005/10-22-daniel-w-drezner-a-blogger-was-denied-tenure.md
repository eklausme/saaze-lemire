title: "Daniel W. Drezner: a blogger was denied tenure"
---



Through [Jean-Pierre Cloutier&rsquo;s blog](http://cyberie.qc.ca/jpc/2005/10/blogues-universitaires-risque.html), I got to [this post by Daniel Dreszner](http://www.danieldrezner.com/archives/002353.html), an assistant professor at the University of Chicago who was recently denied tenure. It would seem he suspects his blogging activities have something to do with his dismissal, but I like his analysis:

> That said, if one assumes that the opportunity cost of blogging (e.g., better or more scholarship) was the difference between tenure and no tenure &#8211; an unclear assertion at best &#8211; then it&rsquo;s a tough call. From a strict cost-benefit analysis, one could argue that the doors that blogging opened could have been deferred for a few years in return for the annuity of a tenured position at Chicago. That said, if I did things only for the money, I never would have entered the academy in the first place. And I&rsquo;ve enjoyed the psychic rewards of blogging way too much to regret my choice.


I think he has the right attitude. 

__Update__: Annie Patenaude correctly points out she is the one who pointed me to Jean-Pierre Cloutier&rsquo;s blog.
