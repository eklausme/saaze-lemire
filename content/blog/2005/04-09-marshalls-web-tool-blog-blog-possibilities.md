Wow. According to [Marshall](https://marshallk.blogspot.com/2005/04/blog-possibilities.html), the New York Times reported last year that blogging can be an effective way to get a job:

> 
&ldquo;It&rsquo;s a trend on the rise right now,&rdquo; Mr. Gartenberg [industry analyst at JupiterResearch] said, &ldquo;especially for employers, who get a much better sense of a person this way. Resumes and interviews are a very scripted process; read someone&rsquo;s Web log and you get a good sense of that person&rsquo;s thinking and perspectives.&rdquo;


I actually believe this. If you are a small or distributed company, this might be a very effective way to find interesting potential recruits.

I don&rsquo;t think universities are yet desperate enough to hire professors based on Ph.D. students blogs. But for many less &ldquo;formal&rdquo; jobs, this seems like a great way to go.

I must be honest: I hired people based on their web sites, and I&rsquo;ve recommended to students that they setup a web site as a way to increase their employability.

Now, what about me? I&rsquo;m rather nasty on this blog sometimes, so I probably decrease my employability. What do you think? Do I increase or decrease the probability that I&rsquo;ll get a sudden job offer by running this blog?
