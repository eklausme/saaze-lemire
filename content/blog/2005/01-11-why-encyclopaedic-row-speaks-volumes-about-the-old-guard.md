I certainly can see this phenomenon among many researchers. For them, research is about specifying what ought to be in a top-down approach. 

Planning is important: for things you can plan. You cannot plan an encyclopia. You cannot design an encyclopedia using a top-down approach. You cannot design most software using a top-down approach (you can, but your project will fail when you&rsquo;ll face what you didn&rsquo;t plan for). You can&rsquo;t do research in a top-down approach (but you can if you want to build a particule accelerator).
