&ldquo;Tall, Dark, and Mysterious&rdquo; the funniest math. geek on the web [decided to go ask for job advice](http://talldarkandmysterious.ca/). She is obviously extremely smart and can&rsquo;t find a decent job with a M.Sc. in Mathematics. I think she sums it very well:

> Like many members of my demographic &#8211; gifted kids of professionals, who were directed to seek scholarship, rather than employment, in their studies, and who were never given much guidance with regards to the latter &#8211; I am finding myself suspended between two distinct groups that are, for opposite reasons, ill-suited to help me. On the one hand are the intellectuals who can&rsquo;t fathom a universe outside the academy, and hence cannot help me find my way in that world; on the other, the folks who never studied a subject as abstract and as technical as mathematics beyond the high school level, and consequently can&rsquo;t provide the specialized direction I need to apply my own abstract and technical interests and skills outside the academy. Frustrating, because I know that there are math folks employed in statistics and in finance and in the military and elsewhere, and they didn&rsquo;t hatch ready-made inside their cubicles.


The lesson here is that getting degrees without thinking about job prospects is a __dangerous game__. Feel free to play the game, but make sure you know what you are risking.
