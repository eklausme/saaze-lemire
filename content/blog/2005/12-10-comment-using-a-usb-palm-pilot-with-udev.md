<p>This was very helpful thanks a lot. But instead of creating symbolic link I just tell jpilot to look at : /dev/zire </p>
<p>this is what I put under name in udev. I was looking for an easy solution to the permission problems because before I could only run jpilot as root which I wasn&rsquo;t happy about. Thanks again.</p>
