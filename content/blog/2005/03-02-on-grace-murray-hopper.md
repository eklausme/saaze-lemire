>If you want to get something done, do it first. Apologize (if apologies are necessary) later.

Don&rsquo;t let anyone tell you you can&rsquo;t succeed, especially if you are a woman.

Or, put in another way, be __pig headed__. That&rsquo;s generally not bad advice, but you should not disregard facts and evidence.
