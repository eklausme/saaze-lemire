Tall, Dark, and Mysterious talks about Vegetables of revolution:

I turned the squash in my hand, and said, That&rsquo;s what I said before, &ldquo;symmetric vegetables&rdquo;. This one is perfectly even, see? &#8211; turn it around and it doesn&rsquo;t wobble. Same with this carrot.

That&rsquo;s it. Next time I have to teach about volumes of revolution, I&rsquo;ll use vegetables.
