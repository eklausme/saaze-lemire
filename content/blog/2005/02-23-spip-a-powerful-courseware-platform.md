title: "SPIP: a powerful courseware platform?"
---



Some of my colleagues, including Michel Sénécal et Jean Robillard, have begun using [SPIP](http://www.spip.net/en) to develop online courses. I didn&rsquo;t know the first thing about SPIP and it seems to have a strong &ldquo;non-anglocentric flavor&rdquo; (it comes from France) which might explain why I didn&rsquo;t know about it. It is a free PHP-based Content Management Platform fairly similar to [Plone](http://plone.org/) though it seems more versatile than Plone.

From the SPIP web site:

> 
SPIP is a publishing system developed by the minirézo to manage the site uZine. We provide it to anyone as a free software under GPL license. Therefore, you can use it freely for your own site, be it personnal, co-operative, institutional or commercial.


I actually think I will give it a try the next time I develop an online course.

__Update:__ I&rsquo;m disappointed that SPIP doesn&rsquo;t seem to generate valid XHTML. It seems to be a recurring problem, but there are some (difficult) workarounds.
