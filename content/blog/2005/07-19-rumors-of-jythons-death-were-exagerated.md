Jython 2.2a1 is out! (see also [here](http://www.tbray.org/ongoing/When/200x/2005/07/18/Jython-2.2a1) and [here](https://seanmcgrath.blogspot.com/2005_07_17_seanmcgrath_archive.html#112165075159553642)). This is great news. I use Jython a bit, but up to now, with some caution as it always seems like the project is about to die and bring me code down with it.

However, if version numbers are any indication, Jython is still behind [Python](https://www.python.org/) which is at 2.4.1, but the be fair, the release notes say that they are at 2.3 and beyond:

>Welcome to Jython 2.2a1<br/>
=======================

This release includes many major changes since the last full release:

 &#8211; new-style classes<br/>
&#8211; Java Collections integration<br/>
&#8211; PEP 302 implementation<br/>
&#8211; iterators<br/>
&#8211; generators<br/>
&#8211; __future__ division<br/>
&#8211; support for running on JDK1.5<br/>
&#8211; new installer<br/>
&#8211; a significant number of features to bring Jython in line with CPython<br/>
&#8211; many, many bugfixes

It was compiled a OS X with JDK1.4 but should run on JDK 1.2 +.

The full set of changes are too numerous to list in detail. Please consult<br/>
the sourceforge tracker for all closed issues since the last release.

This version of Jython has support for most of Python 2.2 and numerous features from Python 2.3 and beyond. A more comprehensive list will be forthcoming.

Anyhow, if you are like me and can&rsquo;t stand Java verbose style, Jython is a great alternative especially if you want to cook up an application fast. It is not as great as Java for designing APIs though because while Java can call Jython, it is a bit of a pain to do so.
