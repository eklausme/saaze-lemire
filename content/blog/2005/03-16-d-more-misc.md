I don&rsquo;t know how reliable this is, but through Didier, I learned that French is the third language spoken in the US. Here are the numbers:

Rank                     |Language                 |Speakers                 |
-------------------------|-------------------------|-------------------------|
1                        |English                  |215,423,555              |
2                        |Spanish                  |28,100,725               |
3                        |French                   |1,606,790                |
4                        |Chinese                  |1,499,635                |


It seems amazing that Chinese would not greatly outnumber French. Go figure!
