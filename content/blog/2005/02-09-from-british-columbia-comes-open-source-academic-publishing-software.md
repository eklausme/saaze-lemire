title: "From British Columbia comes Open Source Academic Publishing Software"
---



It seems like a bunch of schools in British Columbia got together to [develop open source academic publishing software.](http://www.sfu.ca/mediapr/news_releases/archives/news01200501.htm)

> The University of British Columbia&rsquo;s Public Knowledge Project (PKP), the Simon Fraser University Library and SFU&rsquo;s Canadian Center for Studies in Publishing (CCSP) have formed a partnership to support the maintenance and ongoing development of the internationally acclaimed open source software developed by PKP.<br/>
(&hellip;)

At the heart of the partnership are three major software programs. Open Journal Systems (OJS) provides online management for journal submissions, peer reviewing, editing, and online publishing and indexing. Open Conference Systems (OCS) manages conference registration, programming and paper submission and publication. The PKP Harvester (PKPH) is used to automatically create an online index of materials from a variety of online sites including journals and repositories such as those housed at the Canadian Association of Research Libraries, which are harvested and reside on an SFU Library server.
