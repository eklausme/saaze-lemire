<p>I did the same thing a few years ago. Worked well for a while. I replaced my first cup of coffee in the morning by a cup of tea (I always liked tea so it was not a sacrifice). Nothing else during the day.</p>
<p>Six or seven months later, I took a cup of coffee. Almost the same thing than a cigarette. After one week, I was back to my old coffee habits.</p>
<p>However, I successfully quited smoking nine years ago. I suppose it&rsquo;s better than nothing for my hearth and, thinking about it, I drink my glass of red wine almost every day.</p>
