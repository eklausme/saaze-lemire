PageRank is this well known Google measure of how _influential_ a web page is.

Conclusions so far:

1. Larger English-speaking schools get a higher PageRank. In Canada, the largest school, the University of Toronto had the top school (equal to Stanford). Somewhat smaller but very reputable schools like McGill don&rsquo;t stand out.
1. There seems to be no obvious correlation between the PageRank of a researcher and its university&rsquo;s. This is somewhat surprising. Researchers at Laval University scored really badly for example, despite a solid PageRank for their university.
