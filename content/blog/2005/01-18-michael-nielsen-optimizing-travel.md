Michael has some advice for travellers, it is worth checking it out!

>Make sure you can carry all luggage onboard, especially on long flights. It makes it less likely that you&rsquo;ll miss connections, you won&rsquo;t lose your luggage, and you&rsquo;re not lugging huge quantities of stuff around.
