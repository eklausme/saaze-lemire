Shane Butler is building a learner to predict AFL game results. I don&rsquo;t know why, but this sounds like fun stuff!

> Its been a while since my I last wrote that I was thinking of building a learner to predict AFL game results. Obviously with the finals starting this week I&rsquo;m a bit late in the season but oh well! I can still simulate the season using the data I&rsquo;ve collected. I&rsquo;ve developed a number of Perl screen scrapers to collect all the data nessasary, which so far includes things like the match fixtures, game results, player stats and people&rsquo;s tips (yes, this will be a hyprid of both historical data and human input). I&rsquo;m at the stage now of using SQL generate things like a Home Ground Advantage (HGA) parameter &#8211; I guess you might call this the ETL stage!!


If he fails with his learner, he could turn this project into an OLAP project! That&rsquo;d be cool!
