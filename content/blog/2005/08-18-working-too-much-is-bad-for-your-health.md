These medical studies are often funny because they state the obvious and seem to have costed a bundle. This being said, proving the obvious can be hard sometimes. Ever tried to prove that a closed loop has an inside and an outside? [Camille Jordan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camille_Jordan) thought it was easy and he made the textbooks by proving it!

With this renewed interest in the obvious, [consider what I found in a recent research report](http://www.webmd.com/?src=RSS_PUBLIC):

> Those who routinely put in overtime or work a long day are thought to be at heightened risk for a variety of ailments, including high blood pressure, heart disease, depression, diabetes, chronic infections, general health complaints, and even death, write the researchers.
