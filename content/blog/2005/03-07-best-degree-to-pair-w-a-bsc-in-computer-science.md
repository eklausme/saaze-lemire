Slashdot is running a discussion on [the Best Degree to Pair w/ a B.Sc. in Computer Science](http://ask.slashdot.org/article.pl?sid=05/03/07/1814219&#038;tid=146&#038;tid=187&#038;tid=4). The answers are interesting and range from a MBA to Mathematics. These two seem to be the most frequent answers. I was not surprised to the MBA there, but Mathematics was a bit more suprising. Here are two quotes from the posts:

> If you want to be a tech for the long haul, perhaps a degree in mathematics.


> Most pairable degree with Computer Science: Mathematics. Affinity for math tells employers you&rsquo;re capable of high level, abstract thought.


This being said, I have a lot of respect for management people, but if everyone becomes a manager, who will be left to manage? The dumb people? Also, with increasingly flat hierarchies, the need for managers should not be so great. Of course, a MBA teaches you more than just management skills (I hope).
