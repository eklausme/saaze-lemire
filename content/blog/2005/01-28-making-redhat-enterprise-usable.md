title: "Making RedHat Enterprise usable"

As part of our blog project, I found out that RedHat Enterprise was a really locked up distribution. However, the nice people at CERN make available apt for RedHat. A very useful tool! All you have to do to update your machine is to use apt-get.

I would go with gentoo, but if you need RedHat Enterprise, this is not a bad choice.
