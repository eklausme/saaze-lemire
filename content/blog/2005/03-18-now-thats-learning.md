Didier took a stab at cryptography. He implemented a toy RSA program &ldquo;that can encrypt and decrypt a whole file&rdquo;. His Python program is available for download from his blog.

That&rsquo;s what I call __learning__. There is a pretty good chance that Didier has a solid grasp of the RSA algorithm now, unlike someone who read about it in textbooks.

Well, that&rsquo;s pretty much the type of learning I do all day too.

Oh! And that&rsquo;s eLearning too! Indeed, the fact that computers are readily available and cheap makes it much easier to study algorithms.
