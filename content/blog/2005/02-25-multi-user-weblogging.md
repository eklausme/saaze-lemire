From [Downes&rsquo;](http://www.downes.ca), I stumbled upon this guide to [Multi User Weblogging](http://incsub.org/blog/?p=266). I&rsquo;ve had good luck with Drupal so far, but like the review says, it is not easy to personalized. Also, again as the review says, WordPress MU is definitively not ready for prime time.
