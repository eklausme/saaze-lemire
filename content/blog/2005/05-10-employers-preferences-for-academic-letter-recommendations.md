This is fun. [This paper on Employers&rsquo; preferences for academic letter recommendations](http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=1050263&amp;coll=ACM&amp;dl=ACM) shows that the opinion of Computer Information Systems professors is more valued than Humanities professors:

> 
A survey was done with 72 corporations to find out the value of professor&rsquo;s reference letters. The null hypothesis was corporations value reference letters from Computer Information Systems (CIS) professors, Business professors, and Humanities &#038; Arts professors equally. Job skills (CIS) and people skills (Humanities &#038; Arts) were considered equally important. Results from a Friedman Test reject the null hypothesis. A Sign Test on multiple comparisons indicated that employers valued professors&rsquo; reference letters in the following order: CIS, Business, then Humanities &#038; Arts. Future research needs to be done to see if employers value CIS reference letters stressing people skills greater then letters stressing job skills and knowledge.


What does this mean exactly? I don&rsquo;t know.
