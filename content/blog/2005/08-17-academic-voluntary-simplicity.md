title: "Voluntary academic simplicity"

Here&rsquo;s a nice article stating that &ldquo;[Money Can Buy Happiness, Up to a Point.](http://www.webmd.com/?src=RSS_PUBLIC)&rdquo; The gist of it is that you are happy if you are richer than your peers, here&rsquo;s the consequence of this theory:

> As incomes in the U.S. tend to rise over the course of our lifetimes, individuals may find themselves on a sort of treadmill, consuming more and more just to maintain a constant level of happiness, they write.


I certainly buy this theory. Looking at the gigantic houses being built around where I live, and considering that people have no more than 2 kids these days, there is clearly a &ldquo;must have a larger house than my friends&rdquo; syndrome.

This &ldquo;rising standards for judging human beings&rdquo; phenomenon can be observed everywhere. We see it in academia a lot where we expect a lot more from younger professors than we did 10 or 20 years ago, but it also applies to many other fields. However, people can&rsquo;t continuously earn more, publish more, work more and know more. Human beings are scalable, but only up to a point. Comes a time where the threadmil will break your legs.

As far as &ldquo;how much money you must earn&rdquo;, I think the solution is quite clearly to leave the threadmil now and choose [voluntary simplicity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Voluntary_simplicity). It is easy and all you risk is being happier.

Is there an academic voluntary simplicity? A way of life where you choose not to continuously publish more, go for larger grants, and have more students? There are people who choose this path, I know some, but nobody ever attempted to organize and promote this choice. I think we ought to do it.
