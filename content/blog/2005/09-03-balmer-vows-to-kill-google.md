title: "Balmer Vows to Kill Google"

[According to slashdot](http://slashdot.org/story/05/09/03/0515250/balmer-vows-to-kill-google), Microsoft CEO, Ballmer, wants to kill Google:

> Ballmer then launched into a tirade about Google CEO Eric Schmidt. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m going to f***ing bury that guy, I have done it before, and I will do it again. I&rsquo;m going to f***ing kill Google.&rsquo; 


I just don&rsquo;t get this type of behavior. I strongly suspect these people are not very happy.
