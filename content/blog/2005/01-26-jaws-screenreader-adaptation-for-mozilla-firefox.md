title: "JAWS Screenreader Adaptation for Mozilla Firefox"
---



From Catherine Roy, I learned that there is now a screenreader for Mozilla Firefox. This is an essential tool for visual impaired Web surfers. The adaptation to Firefox is a GPL but JAWS itself is a commercial (Windows-only?) tool.

What do visually impaired Linux users do? I know [KDE has an accessibility initiative](https://accessibility.kde.org/), but how does it compare with the Windows or Mac universe? Are there screenreaders for Firefox under Linux? I suspect that Linux (or even Mac) is probably behind in this respect?

__Update:__ it looks like Fire Vox could be a better alternative.
