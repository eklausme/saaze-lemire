title: "ThatÂ´s why I tinker"
---



Here&rsquo;s an old quote that&rsquo;s worth repeating from time to time:

> People like me need to do things in order to understand. That&rsquo;s why I build systems. That&rsquo;s why I tinker. That&rsquo;s why I read so much.<br/>
(Jim Gray, IEEE Distributed Systems Online 2004)


Short story: research is not about spending time in the library. Research is about <em>tinkering</em>.
