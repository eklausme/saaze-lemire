title: "Doing the Martin Shuffle"

Through [Will&rsquo;s](http://www.entish.org/wordpress/?p=233) I got to the [Martin Shuffle](http://www.norvig.com/ipod.html) which is a cool randomized algorithm to quickly find sonds on a MP3 player (without browsing them one by one). They implement a nice Markov Decision Process using my favorite language: Python.
