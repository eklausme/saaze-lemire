title: "Spoofing your user agent &ndash; When Firefox tells the world it is Internet Explorer"
---



Some nameless university has some management web site __requiring__ Internet Explorer. If you ask me, that&rsquo;s a lot like requiring GM cars on some highways. Such a web site is no longer a web site, but an Internet Explorer site.

You can often get around these problems by using a Firefox extension called &ldquo;User Agent Switcher&rdquo;. It adds a menu and a toolbar button to switch the user agent of the browser. In effect, the web site will be fooled into thinking it is dealing with Internet Explorer.

My only regret is that unlike Konqueror, it seems Firefox cannot spoof only specific web sites. You switch your user agent for all sites at once.
