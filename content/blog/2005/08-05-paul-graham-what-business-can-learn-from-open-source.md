title: "Paul Graham &ndash; What Business Can Learn from Open Source"
---



[Just read the latest article from Paul Graham](http://www.paulgraham.com/opensource.html#f4n). This guy is so brilliant, it is amazing. Here are some of his insights:

On Business versus technology&hellip;

> It&rsquo;s a lot harder to create something people love than to take something people love and figure out how to make money from it.


About online publishing&hellip;

> Those in the print media who dismiss the writing online because of its low average quality are missing an important point: no one reads the average blog. In the old world of channels, it meant something to talk about average quality, because that&rsquo;s what you were getting whether you liked it or not. But now you can read any writer you want. So the average quality of writing online isn&rsquo;t what the print media are competing against. They&rsquo;re competing against the best writing online. And, like Microsoft, they&rsquo;re losing.


About working 9-5&hellip;

> The basic idea behind office hours is that if you can&rsquo;t make people work, you can at least prevent them from having fun. If employees have to be in the building a certain number of hours a day, and are forbidden to do non-work things while there, then they must be working. In theory. In practice they spend a lot of their time in a no-man&rsquo;s land, where they&rsquo;re neither working nor having fun.


About meetings&hellip;

> 
The problem with the facetime model is not just that it&rsquo;s demoralizing, but that the people pretending to work interrupt the ones actually working. I&rsquo;m convinced the facetime model is the main reason large organizations have so many meetings. Per capita, large organizations accomplish very little. And yet all those people have to be on site at least eight hours a day. When so much time goes in one end and so little achievement comes out the other, something has to give. And meetings are the main mechanism for taking up the slack.
