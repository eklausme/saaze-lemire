Thanks to tools like [HTML Slidy](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/Overview.html) and [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/), you can build nice slide shows using HTML, CSS and some Javascript.

But what if you are lecturing at a distance? Imagine people get to watch you by videoconference while watching your slides. How do they know when to go to the next slide and so on? The solution, I believe, is to use [AJAX](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AJAX). With a little PHP or Python based server-side script, you could control which slide must be displayed and anyone looking at your slide show would be automatically moved to the right slide.

That&rsquo;s it. So simple. Anyone dare try it out? I bet it can be done with 200 lines of PHP and 200 lines of JavaScript, no more.

For extra points, make it so that the administrator can upload a picture (maybe using a webcam) which gets displayed in the right top corner, so that it feels a bit more like a videoconference.
