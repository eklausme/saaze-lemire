title: "Internet killing researchers?"
---



This came to me today: if I didn&rsquo;t have Internet, I would probably work much less. There is just too much to read, too many people to get in touch with. Generally, there is no excuse not to do great research. I suspect that researchers now spend far more hours working because of the this.
How long before people just stop doing research because they can&rsquo;t cope?
