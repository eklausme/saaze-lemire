title: "A sample paper review"
---



I didn&rsquo;t get any silly review this year, but the year is young, I&rsquo;m sure I&rsquo;ll get a crappy review like this by the end of the year.

[Suresh](http://blog.geomblog.org/2005/04/sci-reviews.html) posts an actual paper review: (I assume he got it for one of his papers or it was shared with him)
&#8212; Comments to the author(s):<br/>
The paper is technically poor and also the results.<br/>
The authors did not refer appropriately the past work.

The author addressed the topic in irrelevant way.

The paper is not clearly written.

No technical or engineering contribution.

&#8212; Summary:<br/>
The paper does not describe the problems and the<br/>
solutions synthetically and the technical options are<br/>
badly explained. The authors must follow common rules<br/>
for writing articles in the domain.</p>

This is an example of a clearly unacceptable review. The reviewer lacks any kind of __generosity__. Here&rsquo;s how you review a paper: unless you can tell, in precise terms, what is wrong, then you must assume that it is right. That&rsquo;s the generosity principle.

Let&rsquo;s look at what the review says piece by piece:
```C
The paper is technically poor and also the results.
```


What does this mean? What is technically poor? Why are the results poor? If you know, tell us, if you don&rsquo;t know why it is poor, we don&rsquo;t want to hear about your opinion.
```C
The paper is not clearly written.
```


Give an example or two. If the paper is not clear, then you should be able to quote a few parts that are clearly obscur and explain why they are obscur.
```C
The authors did not refer appropriately
the past work.
```


Like what? What are the missing references? Or do you mean the author didn&rsquo;t cite __your__ work?
```C
No technical or engineering contribution.
```


Are you saying the paper had no abstract explaining the contribution of the paper? If so, say it, if not, explain why it is not a worthy contribution.

Please, we must keep turning papers down. We must keep failing students. But we must do it __generously__. Reject people and papers in a way that they can improve themselves and their papers. Be specific about what is wrong. Suggest changes.

You&rsquo;ve been warned. If I get a crappy review like this in the future, I&rsquo;ll post it here and explain why it is unacceptable.
