title: "Now you can prepare your math slides using MathML!!!"

You know TeX, you know HTML and you don&rsquo;t like PDF or PowerPoint slides? Leverage the fact that Firefox supports MathML and your troubles are over!

Following one of my earlier posts, [Peter Jipsen](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/) was nice enough to email me to let me know that [ASCIIMathML](http://www1.chapman.edu/~jipsen/asciimath.html) officially works with both [HTML Slidy](http://www.w3.org/Talks/Tools/Slidy2/Overview.html) and [S5](http://meyerweb.com/eric/tools/s5/). Peter has proof in the form of an [online set of slides](http://math.chapman.edu/~jipsen/talks/MathFest2005/slidy/JipsenMathFestSlides2005.html).
