<p>Hi,</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m not very familiar with Oracle business Intelligence Suite. I&rsquo;m an Oracle DBA using cognos Business Intelligence Suite&#8230; But i did some searches on some oracle Internal sites (metalink, otn&#8230;) and the only thing i found is about the JSR-0..69. Oracle was talking about integrating JOLAP in their Oracle 9i OLAP&#8230; However i didn&rsquo;t find any occurence of this word &ldquo;JOLAP&rdquo; in the Oracle 10g. I even think that this White paper is out of date üôÇ</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t think that JOLAP is dead ( like MDAPI : Several years ago the OLAP Council created MDAPI, an open API for multidimensional databases and OLAP applications. This API never gained acceptance in the market place ) because it&rsquo;s used by Mandrian which was recently integrated to the Pentaho OLAP Server. This article is in french </p>

</code></p>
<p> and which is gaining a lot of interest by the industry.</p>
<p>Personnaly i think there is a serious war between Oracle, IBM&#8230;and Microsoft in this field. That&rsquo;s why there&rsquo;ll probably never be a Cross-Platform OLAP query Standard üôÅ</p>

<p>JSR-69 spec doesn&rsquo;t exist (it is only for evaluation).</p>
<p>According to JCP 2.1 (the process used for JSR-69) the Specification Final Release will be posted after Final Approval Ballot. </p>
<p>This never happends. So, the only version of the specification is the last DRAFT, according to it&rsquo;s license, it only for evaluation. </p>
<p>I asked people working on JCP but I have no answers.</p>
