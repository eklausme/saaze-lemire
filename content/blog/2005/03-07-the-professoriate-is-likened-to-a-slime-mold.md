This post makes the point that university professors are essentially self-organizing:

> (&hellip;) universities are valuable primarily as the habitat of academic disciplines, whose self-organizing systems cannot be brought under central command. Bossing academics is like herding ants &#8212; creatures that are relatively feeble unless permitted to exercise their collective genius for self-organization.


So! That&rsquo;s what universities are? Habitats for disciplines&hellip; Hmmm&hellip;
