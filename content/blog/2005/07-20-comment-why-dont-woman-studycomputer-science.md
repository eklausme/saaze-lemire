<p>At first glance, the correlation with TV may sound like a bit of an off-the-top-of-the-head, brain-fart kind of idea. But &#8230; Maria was the CS department head at UBC for most of the time I was there (before moving to higher positions at UBC, then to ACM president, then to Princeton dean). She is one of the most amazing people I have ever had the good fortune to know: dynamic, witty, formidable, incisive, deeply compassionate, and just plain smart. She was concerned about female enrollment in CS way back then (~1990), and did some relevant research of her own. She was mainly engaged in HCI-style research on electronic games for education in math and science (e-gems), and in that context most of her work focused on gender differences in game play. She was trying to understand (among other things) where the difference in attitude toward IT begins. So if she is now saying that she thinks TV has something to do with it, then there might just be something to it.</p>
