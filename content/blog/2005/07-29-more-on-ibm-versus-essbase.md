I wrote earlier that IBM announced it would no longer sell its DB2 OLAP Server. [It looks like the move by IBM might mean that they plan to focus on their own OLAP product:](http://www.rittman.net/)

> in fact it&rsquo;s more to do with their current focus on their Cube Views product, which in his opinion is more likely to be IBM&rsquo;s future OLAP direction.


So DB2 Cube Views will be the main IBM OLAP product?
