<p>Thank you very much for your blog, However I kindly disagree with you after being an IT professional for more than 15 years, I&rsquo;ve recently earned my MSc from a known university and unfortunately I was very poorly turned down when I tried to provide them with a proposal to improve their Unix infrastructure. In the real world such talents are normally accepted and embraced by the employer, however most universities are very close to let students interfere with the infrastructure that has been defined by rules and regulations that are much bigger than a normal IT department. </p>
<p>They should have allowed pilule in the first place and provide the young author the ability and support, This issue has nothing to do with IT departments it&rsquo;s in fact a world wide issue that universities lack to support innovators such as the young author you described in your blog.</p>
