<p><em>Why are you letting them know? â€”</em></p>
<p>Because these job ads rub me the wrong way. They show a lack of respect for techies.</p>
<p>I may not be looking for a job right now, but I expect companies to respect people with tech. skills.</p>

<p>Yes, the first thing I do when looking for a job is to discard all the employers that are looking for people with very specific skills to fit their needs (e.g experience with C++, MFC, MySQL and Perl) instead of a more generic (e.g {Bachelor, Master&rsquo;s} degree in plus experience in one of the following languages: ).</p>
<p>I found that these companies usually work on a hire lot indiscriminately in good times and fire equally indiscriminately. It indicates that they are not willing to hire a smart person, invest in him, and keep him happily employed and rewarded appropriately: they want a disposable employee that can hit the ground running.</p>
<p>Why are you letting them know? &#8212; it as a great filter to use :).</p>
