Exceptional scientists are often a bit crazy:

- [Kurt GÃ¶del](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kurt_G%C3%B6del) starved to death when his wife was hospitalized. He was paranoid.
- [John Nash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Forbes_Nash,_Jr.) suffered from paranoid schizophrenia.
- [Paul ErdÃµs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_Erd%C5%91s) was a homeless itinerant most of his life.
- [Henry Cavendish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Henry_Cavendish) was so shy that he only communicated with his servants by writing notes.
- [Theodore Kaczynski](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theodore_Kaczynski) (the Unabomber) became assistant professor at the University of California at Berkeley at the age of 25, before going to live in a cabin without electricity or running water.
- [Nikola Tesla](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nikola_Tesla) was obsessive compulsive and mysophobic.
