title: "Is Wikipedia anti-intellectual?"
---



[Sanger](http://larrysanger.org/) recently posted a [provocative piece](http://larrysanger.org/2011/06/is-there-a-new-geek-anti-intellectualism/) where he argues that geeks suffer from anti-intellectualism. His stance is that democratic sites such as  Wikipedia (which he co-founded) are founded on anti-intellectualism. He sums up this <em>techno anti-intellectualism</em> using five beliefs:

1. Experts do not deserve any special role in declaring what is known.
1. Books are an outmoded medium because they involve a single person speaking from authority.
1. The classics, being books, are also outmoded.
1. The digitization of information means that we don&rsquo;t have to memorize nearly as much.
1. You don&rsquo;t have to go to college, which is overpriced and so reserved to the elite anyway.


My take:

1. __In the Google era, we do not need formal experts as much as we used to.__ Back in the days, if you wanted to learn about [combinatorics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Combinatorics), you took a class in college. In fact, you probably had to take a class to even know what combinatorics was! The other alternative was to read the papers and the books on the topic, which were only accessibly from a college library. These days, you can get in touch with hundreds of passionate fans of combinatorics on [Math Overflow](http://mathoverflow.net/) where you can ask and answer questions, and even build a reputation. You can read, for free, the [Electronic journal of combinatorics](http://www.combinatorics.org/). The same is true of just about every topic.
1. __The dominance of the long form (e.g., books) was a by-product of our technology.__ If you are going to print and distribute a piece of work, it needs to have a certain volume for the operation to be financially viable. If you sell a 300-pages philosophy book for $50 and make a profit, you cannot easily sell a 3-page philosophical document for $0.50 and still make a profit because you have fixed fees and because few people can be bothered to drive to a bookstore to buy 3 pages. Moreover, books need to be self-contained, you cannot use hyperlinks to refer the reader to background knowledge. That is not to say that long documents are a thing of the past (e.g., the Harry Potter novels), but electronic media is more flexible.
1. __I conjecture that the classics have never been so popular.__ I constantly refer back to the classics through [Project Gutenberg](http://www.gutenberg.org/wiki/Main_Page) or [ebooksgratuits.com](http://www.ebooksgratuits.com/ebooks.php). I constantly read about bloggers who cite the classics. I talk with a lot of people who reread classics on their kindle or iPad.
1. __Memorization is shallow learning, we learn by applying ideas.__ Anyone can memorize the three axioms of Newton. [Denis G. Rancourt famously showed](https://activistteacher.blogspot.com/2010/01/canadian-education-as-impetus-towards.html) that his fourth-year Physics students did not understand these three axioms. Memorization gives you the illusion of knowledge. It is a dangerous illusion.
1. __You can succeed without college, and a college degree is not success.__ It used to be that a college degree, any college degree, meant that you were a success. Anyone who holds on to this belief is in for a rude awakening.


__Further reading__: [Fear of Illegibility](http://onthespiral.posterous.com/fear-of-illegibility) by Rader is another take on Sander&rsquo;s essay.
