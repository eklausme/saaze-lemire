<p>While not yet release the Manning book R in action (available in the MEAP program) is not only a good beginner guide, but is very well organized and provides education on statistical methods for those not versed in the subject. A very good book for programmers with decent Math education, but not enough statistics courses under their belts&#8230;</p>
<p>I would say that it is not a great &ldquo;reference&rdquo; but it points you at the right set of starting packages in a task oriented way.</p>
