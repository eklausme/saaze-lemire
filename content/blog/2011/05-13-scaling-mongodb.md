<img decoding="async" style="float: right;margin:5px; " src="http://covers.oreilly.com/images/0636920018308/cat.gif" alt />I have been spending much time thinking about a future where [document-oriented databases](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Document-oriented_database) are the default. Though they have their problems, I think that they are far better suited for what most people want to do than relational databases.

[MongoDB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mongodb) is one of the best document-oriented database system around: it is mature, scalable, open source and commercially supported.  You can [set it up to run](https://docs.mongodb.org/ecosystem/platforms/amazon-ec2/) Amazon&rsquo;s cloud in minutes.

A long time ago, the good people at O&rsquo;Reilly sent me a copy of [Scaling MongoDB](https://www.amazon.com/Scaling-MongoDB-Kristina-Chodorow/dp/1449303218/ref=sr_1_1?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1305335006&amp;sr=8-1) by Kristina Chodorow, one of the developers of MongoDB. Kristina has a total of [four books](http://www.oreilly.com/pub/au/4500) at O&rsquo;Reilly.  This one is short, but the writing is nearly perfect. The book looks beautiful too. And no, not all O&rsquo;Reilly books are that good.

If you are new to MongoDB, you should get a more complete book like [MongoDB: The Definitive Guide](http://shop.oreilly.com/product/9781449381561.do). Scaling MongoDB is about the specific, but important issues raised by scalability. Having a separate book makes sense. Indeed, [Learning the basics](https://docs.mongodb.org/getting-started/shell/) of MongoDB is not hard. But figuring it out [sharding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sharding) is a lot harder and deserves a book.
