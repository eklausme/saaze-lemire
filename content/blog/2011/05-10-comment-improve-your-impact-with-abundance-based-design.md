<p>I agree, that is why I wrote: <em>(&#8230;) you should have a feeling of urgency, not worry</em>.</p>
<p>Urgency is important. You should feel pulled to move forward. You should be eager to get going, to get results.</p>
<p>You should not sit around waiting for your muse. Nobody gets anything important done without urgency.</p>
<p>You should also not start overwhelming projects that will take you 30 years (because then you won&rsquo;t be in abundance mode).</p>

<p>I generally agree. The question &ldquo;are we on-time and on-budget&rdquo; is a good one to ask if you are building a house. But it is totally the wrong question in the context of a R&amp;D project, and, to a lesser extent in software development. The right question to ask there is &ldquo;are we building the right thing?&rdquo;.</p>
<p>That said, even in a R&amp;D context, I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s a good idea to be too complacent about the passing of time. When I start working on a project, there is immediately a clock that starts ticking in my head, because I know that if I don&rsquo;t produce some results and impact within a reasonable timeframe, someone will (rightly so) start questionning why I am spending that much time on it.</p>

<p>Daniel, I must say you have hit the nail on the head. I have been and will be (much to my chagrin) with scarcity based design and hence has low impact. </p>
<p>I am not sure if there exists any such terminology(abundance based or scarcity based design) but the terminology is great!</p>
