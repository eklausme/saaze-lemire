title: "On being happy"

What if you could engineer happiness? What if you could redesign your life so that you are happier? With professors in mind, Brian Martin wrote an essay entitled [On being a happy academic](http://www.bmartin.cc/pubs/11aur.pdf) with this very purpose. He outlines a few elements that you should take into account if you want to be happier.

__Flow__

This is the state of mind you reach when you apply your best skills. For example, when programming, I can literally forget about the rest of the world for a couple of hours. [Programming makes me happy](/lemire/blog/2011/06/06/why-i-still-program/). I can also enter a state of flow while writing: I am never unhappy while blogging. Writing research papers is also enjoyable as long as the topic is neither routine nor beyond my grasp. I enjoy writing study notes, as long as I can challenge my students (and myself) a bit in the process.

Alas, part of my job also involves tasks which do not lead to the flow. They can make me unhappy. For example, a single administrative meeting can darken my mood for several days. But even good meetings fail to contribute to my happiness. In recent years, I have worked hard to avoid meetings, or to, at least, protect my mood from them. Politics is especially harmful to me: I work hard to stay out of it. It helps that I need very little from others, beside my salary. Even boring routine work such as grading assignments is better for me than internal politics. Everything I do is geared toward getting myself back in the flow as soon as possible.

__Relationships__

A lot of happiness is derived from our social network. In this respect, I am lucky to have a great family with two kids I love. I have also pursued, over the years, research collaborations: without those relationships, I would not have remained so active as a researcher. I have also found blogging to be a great way to meet people without disrupting too much my ability to remain in the flow. I have very satisfying online relationships with people I rarely meet in person.

__Helping others__

Feeling useful is important. Sometimes I help others by reviewing papers: I can spend 10% of my time reviewing research papers. I try to share as much as possible: I post my software and study notes online. As an academic, however, I have found that it is sometimes difficult to &ldquo;feel useful&rdquo;. Almost by definition, much of what we do appears useless. And  it is!

__Mindfulness__

If you are constantly &ldquo;in the moment&rdquo;, you may lack perspective. I have found that a great way to be more mindful is to stop working all the time.

__What is not included:__ Do big research grants, papers in prestigious journals and prestigious positions make you happier? I have had both more and less prestigious positions, and, to me, it made no difference. In fact, in going from a puny graduate student to tenured professor, I saw no improvement in my happiness. My happiness was at its lowest while I was running a research group in Canada&rsquo;s largest research institution (NRC). While I enjoy doing the research and writing articles, I have had the surprising realization that having an article accepted in a good journal could sometimes put me in a bad mood. Mostly, what makes me happy is when people use my work: I derive little pleasure from an article that nobody reads, even if it appeared in a prestigious journal.  Research grants are very prestigious but, in my experience, they contribute nothing to my happiness. And bigger grants are worse: they attract false collaborations and administrative work.

__Note:__ Instead of blogging, I should be working on a grant application right now.
