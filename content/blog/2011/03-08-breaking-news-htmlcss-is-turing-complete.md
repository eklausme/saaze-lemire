title: "Breaking news: HTML+CSS is Turing complete"
---



A programming language is [Turing complete](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Turing_complete) if it equivalent to a Turing machine. In practice, it means that any algorithm can be implemented. Most programming languages are Turing complete, including [SQL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL/PSM), ECMAScript, Java, C, and so on.

[HTML5 + CSS3](http://lambda-the-ultimate.org/node/4222) is also Turing complete because it can be used to program a [Rule 110 automaton](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rule_110).
